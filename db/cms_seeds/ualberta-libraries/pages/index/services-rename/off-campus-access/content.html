<h2>Off Campus Access</h2>
<p>
	Access to many of the resources on the University of Alberta website
        is restricted to students, faculty and staff.
</p>
<p>
	Simply navigate to the e-journal or database you wish to use via
            the Library Home Page and 
	<strong>log in</strong> using your
	<strong>Campus Computing ID and Password.</strong>
</p>
<h3>EZProxy</h3>
<p>
	Are you having an Ezproxy login problem from off-campus? Use our
	<a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/offcampusaccess/index.cfm"><strong>report a
        problem form
	</strong></a> to allow us to respond.
</p>
<p>
	The library's 
	<strong>EZProxy server</strong> is especially
        configured for library resources. You don't need to do anything special
        to access it: you will automatically be directed to the EZProxy log-in
        screen if you are off campus. Enter your Campus Computing ID and
        password. You do not need to make any changes to your browser's
        configuration.
</p>
<p>
	EZProxy uses cookies to keep track of your session, so that you
        don't have to log in again to access new resources. EZProxy will not
        work if your browser does not accept cookies. These cookies contain
        only your session key, and expire when you close your browser.
</p>
<p>
	Once you have logged in using your 
	<strong><a href="https://ist.ualberta.ca/services/ccid-passwords/campus-computing-id">Campus Computing ID</a></strong>,
        you will be able to access any of the library's restricted resources
        without having to log in again. Your log-in will expire after two hours
        of inactivity, or whenever you close your browser; after that you will
        be directed to the log-in screen again before you can access another
        restricted resource.
</p>
<h3>EZProxy prefix</h3>
<p>
	To facilitate off-campus access to our online resources, add the
        EZProxy prefix "http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=" before the web address.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">For example, the following is a URL for an online article:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi8006143">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi8006143</a>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;">Once the EZProxy prefix is included, the link will appear as follows:
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20px;"><a href="http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi8006143">http://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/bi8006143</a>
</p>

<h3>Third Party EZProxy Browser Extensions</h3>
<p>
	Several third party browsers extensions are available to help access licensed material from off campus including:
</p>
<ul class="alist">
	<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ezproxy-redirect/gfhnhcbpnnnlefhobdnmhenofhfnnfhi?hl=en">Ezproxy Redirect</a> (Chrome)</li>
</ul>
<h3>EZProxy URLs</h3>
<p>
	While you are using the EZProxy server to access a restricted
        resource, the URL in your browser's address box will be modified. For
        example, a database might have a URL like this when you access it on
        campus:
</p>
<pre>http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/kirk/index.html
</pre>
<p>
	With EZProxy, it will look like this:
</p>
<pre>http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/kirk/index.html
</pre>
<p>
	If you want to extract the "original" URL from an EZProxy URL, just
        remove the ".login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca" from the end of the
        domain name.  Leave the rest of the URL as it is.
</p>
<h3>Shibboleth Authentication</h3>
<p>A number of vendors support Shibboleth authentication that will allow you to login directly at the vendor web site.  Look for a "Login" link and then select University of Alberta (often located under the label Canadian Access Federation or CAF).  Vendors that currently support Ualberta login credentials include:<br>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>HathiTrust</li>
	<li>Taylor and Francis</li>
</ul>
<h3>LibX</h3>
<p>
	LibX is a Firefox extension that provides direct access to your
        Library's resources. It features:
</p>
<ul class="circle">
	<li>Toolbar & right-click context menu</li>
	<li>Support for off-campus access via EZProxy</li>

<h3>UAL Bookmarklet</h3>
<p>
	Sometimes you want to access library e-resources from off-campus         without going through the library website Maybe somebody sent you an         email or a Twitter link to a great journal article, or you found         something through 
	<a href="http://scholar.google.ca/">Google Scholar</a>. Rather than hitting a paywall, you         can use these bookmarklets to quickly authenticate yourself as a UofA         user and access the full text. It's quick and easy to install in your         Web browser.

<h3>Additional Help</h3>
<p>
	Databases and ejournals should work the same way whether you are on
        campus accessing them directly, or off campus accessing them through
        the EZProxy server. If you encounter any difficulties when using the
        EZProxy server, please send details (including the URL you were trying
        to access) to our 
	<a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/askus/">Ask
        Us
