<h2 style="text-align: center;">3D Printing in Cameron</h2><p style="text-align: center;">

</p><h3>What is 3D printing?</h3><p>
	3D printers use digital models to fabricate three-dimensional objects, successively printing or forming layers of material, one at a time, until an object is fully rendered.
</p><h3>Why is the Library offering this service?</h3><p>Cameron Library now provides 3D printing services in collaboration with the Faculty of Science and the Physics Department's <em><a href="http://sciencehardwarespace.org/" target="_blank">Science Hardware Space: The Shack</a></em><br>
</p><p>This is a unique opportunity for UAlberta students, faculty, and staff to access 3D printing technology in a central space.
</p><p>As the University of Alberta Libraries' vision is to inspire â€œexploration, connection, and discovery," we are pleased to be able to offer 3D printers in our space.
</p><h3>What equipment and materials do we use?</h3><p>
	We currently have five Machina mk2 printers on the main floor of Cameron Library on the east-side of our Service Desk.
</p><p>
	The printers use a plant-based and biodegradable PLA  filament. It does not contain BPA or cause air quality degradation.
</p><h3>Who is eligible to 3D Print?</h3><p>
	Any University of Alberta student, faculty, and staff member who wants to print a 3D object for educational purposes is eligible to use the 3D printers in Cameron Library. This may include models for an assignment, research instruments, prototypes of a theoretical design, etc. 
</p><h3>What size of object is eligible to print?</h3><p>
	We recommend submitting models that will print in 4-6 hours, so items roughly the size of a golf ball or that can sit in the palm of your hand. Larger prints may be considered upon consultation.
</p><p>
	Most 3D modelling software provides an object's estimated print time. For example, you can do this if you employ 
	<a href="http://slic3r.org/"><u>Slic3r</u></a> on a 3D model in Repetier-Host.
</p><h3>How much does it cost?</h3><p>
	As this is a pilot project, this service is completely free for students, faculty, and staff!
</p><h3>How do I print a 3D object?</h3><p>
	#1 - Get your
	<strong><a href="/services/3dprinting/preparing-3d-model" data-no-turbolink="true">3D model ready</a></strong>
</p><p>
	#2 - Save the model as .stl file (maximum size 10 MB)

</p><h3>3D Printing Policies</h3><ol>
	<li>The library's 3D printers may only be used for lawful academic purposes. No one is permitted to create material that is:
	<ul>
		<li>For commercial purposes</li>
		<li>Prohibited by local, provincial, or federal law.</li>
		<li>Unsafe, harmful, dangerous, or poses an immediate threat to the well-being of others.</li>
		<li>In violation of another's intellectual property rights. For example, you cannot reproduce material subject to copyright, patent, or trademark protection.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The library reserves the right to refuse any 3D print request.</li>
	<li>The library cannot guarantee model quality or stability, nor confidentiality of designs. Responsibility for removing rafts and supports is up to the user.</li>
	<li>Items must be picked up by the individual who submitted them or their designee, using valid ID. Items not picked up within 30 days after being printed become the property of the UA Libraries.</li>
	<li>The 3D printing queue is prioritized based on factors such as academic priority, class due dates, reprints, and other issues as they arise. We reserve the right to alter queue order based on these factors.</li>
