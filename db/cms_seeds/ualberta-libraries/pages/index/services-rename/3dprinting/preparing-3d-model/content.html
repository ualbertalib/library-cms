<h2 style="text-align: center;">Preparing Your 3D Model</h2><h3>Create/design your 3D model</h3><p>
	There are many resources to help you print something unique. At the moment, print jobs in Cameron Library are limited to 4 hours or less, so keep that in mind when you're creating or searching for a model.
</p><p>
	Lynda.com offers a great introduction to 3D printing, helping you get started:

</p><p>
	To print jobs, we will be using Repetier-Host software with Slic3r in Cameron Library. More information about these products can be found on their websites:

</p><h4>Free 3D Modeling Software:</h4><p>
	To create your own 3D model, you'll need some software. Here are a few free ones you can try:
</p><p>
	<a href="https://tinkercad.com/"><u>Tinkercad</u></a> - a browser-based 3D design platform, now part of Autodesk (free
</p><p>
	version available)
</p><p>
	<a href="http://www.sketchup.com/"><u>SketchUp</u></a> - comes in free or pro versions
</p><p>
	<a href="http://www.blender.org/"><u>Blender</u></a> - open source 3D animation suite
</p><p>
	<a href="http://www.openscad.org/"><u>OpenSCAD</u></a> - free software for creating solid 3D CAD (Computer-aided design)
</p><p>
	models. Useful for creating models of machine parts.

	If you would like assistance in creating your own 3D model, contact the University of Alberta Physics Department's

</p><h4>Free 3D Models:</h4><p>
	There are a variety of open source, freely accessible models online that you can
</p><p>
	download and use. Here are a few:
</p><p>
	<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/"><u>Thingiverse.com</u></a>: MakerBot's searchable design library community.
</p><p>
	<a href="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/"><u>3D Warehouse</u></a>: SketchUp's searchable design library.
</p><p>
	<a href="http://www.instructables.com/group/123d/"><u>Instructables</u></a>: from the AutoDesk community.
</p><h3>Prepare your file to print</h3><h4>File Format</h4><p>
	Export your model as a stereolithography file, with an STL extension (.stl).
</p><h4>Dimensions</h4><p>The maximum size is 100 x 100 x 100 mm, and layer heights are fixed to 0.2 mm. Your model should print in 4-6 hours; however, larger prints may be considered upon consultation.
</p><h4>Multiple Parts</h4><p>
	If your model includes multiple parts, make each as a separate STL file. You can submit each model as part of the same print request.
</p><h4>Checking for Design Problems</h4><p>
	Check your design for holes, gaps, or other problems before submission.
</p><p>
	Numerous third party tools can help you fix geometry problems, including:
</p><ul>
	<li><u><a href="https://modelrepair.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">Microsoft 3D Model Repair service</a></u> - simply upload your model and download a repaired version in minutes. This is a good practice before submitting your model to us.</li>
	<li><u><a href="http://cloud.netfabb.com">NetFabb</a></u> - provides a cloud based service and free downloadable software that can check and repair your files.</li>
	<li><a href="http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/"><u>MeshLab</u></a> - open source software for checking files, and “decimating" models that have higher resolution than necessary.</li>
</ul><p>
	Shapeways offers a tutorial for
	<u><a href="http://www.shapeways.com/tutorials/how_to_use_meshlab_and_netfabb">fixing and repairing 3D models</a>.</u>
</p><h4>Common Modelling Problems</h4><p>
	Other things to be careful of when creating your model:
</p><ul>
	<li>degenerate faces - Mesh faces that have 0 area</li>
	<li>zero length edges - Edges with no length, created by degenerate faces</li>
	<li>non manifold edges - Faces that have more than one face connected to a single edge</li>
	<li>naked edges - A surface or polysurface edge that is not connected to another edge</li>
	<li>duplicate faces - Identical faces in a single mesh</li>
	<li>faces should be flipped - The faces in a mesh object should point in a consistent direction</li>
	<li>disjoint pieces - Mesh objects that do not connect but are considered a single mesh</li>
	<li>surface area too small - prints are connected to the print bed by unstable adhesion, and topple mid print</li>
	<li>objects that contain extreme overhangs—or where large parts of the object are suspended in mid-air</li>
</ul><h3>Submit Your Model</h3><p>
	Once your model is ready to print, fill out the
	<a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/services/3dprinting/">3D print request form</a> and upload your STL file. We'll contact you within 3 business days with an estimate of the turnaround time and to let you know if there are any problems with the file.
