<h3><a href="http://www.crkn.ca/">Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN)</a></h3>
<p>CRKN is a national consortium of 75 university partners dedicated to expanding digital content for the academic research enterprise in Canada.  CRKN undertakes large-scale content acquisition and licensing initiatives in order to build knowledge infrastructure and research capacity in Canada's universities.

The majority of our big package deals for journals from major publishers such as Elsevier, Wiley-Blackwell, Springer, Sage and others, come via CRKN.</p>


<h3><a href="http://www.crl.edu/">Centre for Research Libraries (CRL)</a></h3>
<p>CRL is an international consortium of more than 260 university, college, and independent research libraries. CRL supports advanced research and teaching in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences by preserving and making available to scholars the primary source material critical to those disciplines. CRL acquires and preserves newspapers, journals, documents, archives, and other traditional and digital resources from a global network of sources. Most materials acquired are from outside the United States, and many are from five "emerging" regions of the world: Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Latin America.</p>
<p>CRL provides the University of Alberta Libraries with access to a shared collection of resources.  We also participate in the Cooperative Collection Development program, and purchase electronic resources that are negotiated via CRL.</p>


<h3><a href="http://www.coppul.ca/">Council of Prairie and Pacific University Libraries (COPPUL)</a></h3>
<p>COPPUL is a western Canadian consortium consisting of 22 university libraries located in Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. Member libraries cooperate to enhance information services through resource sharing, collective purchasing, document delivery, and many other similar activities. The University of Alberta Libraries participates in many product offerings for electronic resources from COPPUL.  One example is the COPPUL federation with the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), which makes up a significant  portion of our research data collection.  We also participate actively in other collections related activities such as the Private LOCKSS Network, and the Shared Print Archive Network.</p>
