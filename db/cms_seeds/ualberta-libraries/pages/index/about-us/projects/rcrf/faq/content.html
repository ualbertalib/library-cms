<h3>Research and Collections Resource Facility (RCRF)</h3>
<p><strong>When will the Research and Collections Resource Facility (RCRF) be open to the public?</strong>
</p>
<p>As the RCRF is a high-density storage facility, the building will not be accessible on a walk-in basis to the public or the University of Alberta community. We are opening the Reading Room to the public by appointment by early December.
</p>
<p>To access items in the depository, items must be requested through the online catalogue to be picked up at any NEOS Library. The RCRF will not be a pick-up location for loanable materials.
</p>
<p>We are having an Open House Celebration on September 22, 2017. Please join us for a tour of the facility.
</p>
<p><strong>Will departments and university units still be able to have archival materials delivered?</strong>
</p>
<p><br> Given the new physical location and close proximity of the Archives to Main Campus, the UAlberta Archives will no longer be mailing files/materials via Campus Mail Services to on-campus offices.<br> <br> Access to all materials held in the new RCRF will be need to be accessed on-site by a representative of your respective faculty/department/office.<br> <br> Materials will be made available for you at RCRF to scan/copy as appropriate.<br> <br> This policy and practice is in place to ensure the ongoing control, integrity and security of all records of enduring value in the custody of the UA Archives.
</p>
<p><strong>Is there a reading room for researchers?</strong>
</p>
<p>Yes, the RCRF will have a space available for the public to carry out archival research by appointment. The Archives Collection will have moved to the RCRF by December 2017; however, there will be limited access to the facility in general.
</p>
