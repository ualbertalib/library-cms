<h2>Study and Work Space in the University of Alberta Libraries</h2><p>Campus libraries are places for learning. People need quiet places to learn and work as well as space for group learning and collaboration. Libraries are also centres for teaching, where library staff instruct individuals and groups in the use of information resources and materials. To create an environment that serves each of these needs we have divided library areas, where possible, into three distinct types:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Common Areas</strong> - Usually busy with high traffic levels. These areas are intended as group study areas and / or instructional areas and include library service desk areas. Here, conversational noise is to be expected.

</li>
<li><strong>Quiet Areas</strong> - Intended to serve as quiet space for readers and students. In these areas only low-level talking is permitted.  

</li>
<li><strong>Silent Areas</strong> - Intended to serve as silent, individual study space for readers and students who need to concentrate. No talking is permitted.</li>
</ul><p>Please consult the <strong><a href="/services/study-area-directory">Study Area Directory</a></strong> for designated areas. Each campus library also has a study area directory and signage indicating designated areas.</p><p><strong><a class="fac gra" href="/services/book-study-space">Book Study Space</a></strong></p><p><strong>Appropriate Access and Use:</strong></p><ul><li>Please do not leave your belongings to â€œclaim" a workspace or computer workstation.
