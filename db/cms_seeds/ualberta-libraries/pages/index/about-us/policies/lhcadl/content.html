	The Lois Hole Campus Alberta Digital Library (LHCADL) is an initiative of the Government of Alberta to acquire digital resources for the benefit of post-secondary learners in the Province.  The LHCADL is delivered by The Alberta Library (TAL) through 35 participating post-secondary institutions.
</p>
<p>
	This initiative represents a radical change to the breadth and depth of digital resources available to the participating institutions.  The initiative will also provide the supplementary technical infrastructure, staff resources and information literacy programming required to support the use of the digital content in our learning environment.
