<h4>Sharing Collections</h4>

<p>
As the University of Alberta Libraries continues to grow and change, it gathers duplicate copies or donated material that is already in its collection. A significant portion of this material has the potential to be useful as part of other library collections, and we are pleased to share it with others. These include:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Recent textbooks in all disciplines</li>
	<li>University Press publications in all disciplines</li>
	<li>Scholarly material in disciplines that do not date quickly, particularly in the Humanities and Social Sciences</li>
	<li>Canadiana</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The University of Alberta Libraries international collections exchange program seeks reciprocity but not symmetry. We welcome gifts for our collections from international partners, including:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Locally written and published books</li>
	<li>Material that reflects local history and culture</li>
	<li>Folklore, music, dance and theatre resources</li>
	<li>Other material that is difficult for us to identify or locate</li>
</ul>

<p>	This exchange allows the University of Alberta Libraries to extend its collections in new areas, particularly those related to world history and culture. In this way we are able to support researchers in many disciplines.
</p>
    <h4>Sharing the Future</h4>
  <p>
	The purpose of this program is to work with international partners to develop shared projects. These can be in any area: conferences, shared digitization projects or other emerging themes. If you have ideas, we look forward to discussing them with you.
