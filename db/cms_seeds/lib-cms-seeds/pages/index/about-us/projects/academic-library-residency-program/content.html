<h2>
  Academic Library Residency Program
</h2>
<p>The UAL Academic Library Residency Program is designed to provide recent MLIS graduates with opportunities for early career development and professional work experience in an academic research library. </p>

<p>Established since 1999, the Residency program continues to provide recent graduates with a diverse range of opportunities to explore as new library professionals. From discovering the multitude of opportunities within academic libraries, to developing a network of mentors, colleagues and collaborators within the field, new librarians gain valuable experiences throughout their residency - in addition to pursuing opportunities for professional development and training. </p>

<p>As successful candidates, residents will be assigned to one of the several different units within the University of Alberta Libraries, and will assume a variety of assignments appropriate for an introductory appointment. In addition to their core responsibilities, residents will have the opportunity to collaborate with librarians outside of their home unit on a major project throughout their residency period.</p>

<p>To qualify for the residency program, applicants must:</p>
<ul>

<li>Have graduated from an ALA accredited Canadian library school program within the past year</li>
<li>Commit to a one year contract appointment with the University of Alberta Libraries</li>
  
</ul>
