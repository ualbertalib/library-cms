<h2>Gifts and Donations</h2><h3>Donations of money</h3><p>Financial support is always welcome, and may range from a simple cash gift to various forms of planned or deferred giving such as endowments, annuities, and bequests. Cheques should be made payable to the University of Alberta Libraries, and sent to the <a href="http://www.giving.ualberta.ca/ContactUs.aspx">Office of Advancement</a>.  To explore planned giving options, please contact the <a href="http://www.giving.ualberta.ca/ContactUs.aspx">Office of Advancement</a>.</p><h3>Donations of library materials</h3><p>Donations are only accepted on the understanding that the University becomes the sole owner, and reserves the ultimate right to determine retention, location, level of cataloguing, access, and other considerations related to use or disposition.  If you wish to donate materials, please contact us to discuss your offer in detail. A brief description of subjects covered, while not essential, aids us in considering donation offers.</p><p><strong>Quinn Benders</strong><br>Research &amp; Special Collections Gifts Assistant<br>5-25 Cameron Library<br>University of Alberta<br>Edmonton, AB T6G 2J8<br>Email: qbenders@ualberta.ca<br>Tel: 780-492-7057<br>fax: 780-492-3695 (Attn: Q.
