	<h2>Network Security</h2>
	<p>
		Security is a top priority for the campus information technology community. To ensure the security of our networked services, the University of Alberta Libraries requires authentication for the use of all public workstations
	</p>
	<p>
		What does this mean in practice? Through the public workstations, patrons can search and navigate the Libraries' website and catalogue without authenticating. However, when you leave the Libraries' domain to access databases, ejournals or other Internet resources, you are required to authenticate with a Temporary Network ID or CCID. It will be important that you remember to close the browser and logout when you are done to prevent your ID being used by the next person who uses the workstation

			Campus Computing IDs are issued to the University's faculty, staff and students by IST. For more information about the University's information technology use and management policy, visit:
