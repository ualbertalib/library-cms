<h2>Access to University of Alberta Library Electronic Resources</h2>
<p>
	The University of Alberta Library licenses a wide range of electronic journals, e-books, abstracting/indexing databases and numerical databases from commercial vendors. These licenses restrict use of these resources to primary affiliates, i.e. current University students, faculty and staff (based on valid student or employee numbers). However, our licenses do permit "walk-in"/on-campus use by guest affiliates and the wider community at public computer stations within the University Library or via the University of Alberta wireless network.
</p>
<p>
	For more specific license information, follow the links to "Conditions of Use" for individual titles in the 
	<a href="https://search.library.ualberta.ca/databases?sort=title_sort+asc%2C+pub_date_sort+desc&amp;view=brief">Databases Titles List</a>. If you have further questions, please submit them via the following<a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/ereference/email/"> email form</a>.
</p>
<h3>PRIMARY CCIDs (Current U of A students, faculty and staff)</h3>
<p>
	<a href="/services/off-campus-access">Remote access</a> (from outside the University computing network) to library licensed online resources by primary members of the University community (current students, faculty and staff) requires login to the Library's proxy server using a personal <a href="http://ist.ualberta.ca/id">Campus Computing ID (CCID).</a>
</p>
<p>
	Those with CCIDs who are no longer current students, faculty or staff, with the exception of Professors Emeriti, will not have remote access to library online resources.
</p>
<p>
	Problems logging in to the proxy server should be reported using the following 
	<a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/offcampusaccess/">web form.</a>
</p>
<h3>GUEST CAMPUS COMPUTING IDS</h3>
<p>
	Guest Campus Computing IDs (Guest CCIDs) are issued by U of A faculties/departments to those without a primary affiliation but who maintain a â€œdirect benefit" relationship to the University of Alberta, e.g. academic visitors, AASUA/NASA staff, St. Stephens College students and staff.
</p>
<p>
	Those with Guest CCIDs will have on-campus access to library online resources via library computers, computers in campus offices or labs or via the University of Alberta wireless network but will not have off-campus access to these resources.
</p>
<p>
	Guest CCIDs must be renewed by the sponsoring department, normally, on an annual basis.
</p>
<p>
	For more information on Guest CCIDs, see 
	<a href="http://ist.ualberta.ca/id/additional-ccid">Additional CCID Options</a> on the AICT website.<a name="temp"></a>

	<h2>Network Security</h2>
	<p>
	Security is a top priority for the campus information technology community. To ensure the security of our networked services, the University of Alberta Libraries requires authentication for the use of all public workstations
	</p>
	<p>
	What does this mean in practice? Through the public workstations, patrons can search and navigate the Libraries' website and catalogue without authenticating. However, when you leave the Libraries' domain to access databases, ejournals or other Internet resources, you are required to authenticate with a Temporary Network ID or CCID. It will be important that you remember to close the browser and logout when you are done to prevent your ID being used by the next person who uses the workstation
