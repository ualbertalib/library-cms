<h2>Access to University of Alberta Library Electronic Resources</h2>
<p>
	The University of Alberta Library licenses a wide range of 
	<a href="/journals-search" data-no-turbolink="true"><strong>electronic journals</strong></a>,   <a href="http://guides.library.ualberta.ca/az.php"><strong>databases</strong></a><strong></strong> and e-books from commercial vendors. These licenses restrict use of these resources to primary affiliates, i.e. current University students, faculty and staff (based on valid student or employee numbers). However, our licenses do permit "walk-in"/on-campus use by guest affiliates and the wider community at public computer stations within the University Library or via the University of Alberta wireless network.
</p>
<p>
	For more specific license information, follow the links to "Conditions of Use" for individual titles in the 
	<a href="http://guides.library.ualberta.ca/az.php"><strong>Databases Titles List</strong></a><strong></strong>. If you have further questions, please submit them via the following<a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/ereference/email/"> <strong>Email - Ask us a Question Form</strong></a>.

<h3>GUEST CAMPUS COMPUTING IDS</h3>
<p>
	Guest Campus Computing IDs (Guest CCIDs) are issued by U of A faculties/departments to those without a primary affiliation but who maintain a â€œdirect benefit" relationship to the University of Alberta, e.g. academic visitors, AASUA/NASA staff, St. Stephens College students and staff.
</p>
<p>
	Those with Guest CCIDs will have on-campus access to library online resources via library computers, computers in campus offices or labs or via the University of Alberta wireless network but will not have off-campus access to these resources.
</p>
<p>
	Guest CCIDs must be renewed by the sponsoring department, normally, on an annual basis.
</p>
