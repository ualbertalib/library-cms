  <h2>
    PRIVACY OF CIRCULATION RECORDS
  </h2>

<p>
  The library holds all circulation records in confidence. Library patron information is made available to staff at other NEOS libraries in order to facilitate borrowing privileges at these libraries. Staff will not release to any third party information on the specific titles or subject of those titles a patron has borrowed, or link a borrower's name or other revealing identification with an item out on loan. This includes not providing such information to other borrowers, faculty, police or campus security, credit or collection agencies. This policy covers all current and historical circulation records and Interlibrary Loan transactions.
