<h2>Study and Work Space Policies for the University of Alberta Libraries</h2>
<p "="">Campus libraries are places for learning. People need quiet places to learn and work as well as space for group learning and collaboration. Libraries are also centres for teaching, where library staff instruct individuals and groups in the use of information resources and materials. To create an environment that meets the study and work needs of our campus community, we have established zones in the libraries to suit varying types of study:<br>
</p>

</p>
<!---
<ul>
	<li><strong>Silent <strong>Zone</strong></strong> - Intended to serve as silent, individual study space for readers and students who need to concentrate. No talking is permitted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Quiet <strong>Zone</strong></strong> - Intended to serve as quiet space for readers and students. In these zones only low-level talking is permitted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Collaborative Zone</strong> - Usually busy with high traffic levels. These zones are intended as group study areas and / or instructional areas and include library service desk areas. Here, conversational noise is to be expected. <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/services/book-study-space">Book Group Study Space.</a></li>
