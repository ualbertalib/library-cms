<h2>Welcome to the University Archives</h2>
<p>The Archives is the official repository for the permanently valuable records of the University of Alberta and its affiliated institutions. Our holdings consist of material that is of continuing adminstrative, legal, or historical value. In addition to administrative and academic records, the Archives also collects University publications and the private papers of faculty, staff, students, alumni, and various university-related organizations. The Archives also contains the records of many notable individuals and organizations relating to Alberta and federal politics, the oil sands, theater, education, and western settlement.
</p>
<p>The Archives preserves over 4,400 linear metres of records. This includes textual records, photographs, audio and video recordings, film, microforms, architectural drawings, and maps.
</p>
<p> Please be advised that subject to approval of the University Vice-Provost & Chief Librarian, the University Archives is currently not accepting private records donations. For further information, please contact the University Records Archivist at (780) 248-1304.
