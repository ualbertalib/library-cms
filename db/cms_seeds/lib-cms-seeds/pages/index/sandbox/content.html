<h2>Study and Work Space Policies for the University of Alberta Libraries</h2><p>
To create an environment that meets the study and work needs of our campus community we have established noise level zones in the libraries to suit varying types of study:
</p><p>   {{ cms:snippet noise-zones}}</p><ul>
	<li><strong>Silent <strong>Zone</strong></strong> - Intended to serve as silent, individual study space for readers and students who need to concentrate. No talking is permitted.</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li><strong>Quiet <strong>Zone</strong></strong> - Intended to serve as quiet space for readers and students. In these zones only low-level talking is permitted.</li>
</ul><ul>
  	<li><strong>Collaborative Zone</strong> - Usually busy with high traffic levels. These zones are intended as group study areas and / or instructional areas and include library service desk areas. Here, conversational noise is to be expected. <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/services/book-study-space">Book Group Study Space.</a></li>
</ul><p>Please consult the 
	<strong><a href="/services/study-area-directory" data-no-turbolink="true">Study Area Directory & Noise Zones</a></strong> for designated areas.</p><p>Each campus library also has a study area directory and signage indicating designated areas.
