                two hour block maximum, other libraries permit 2.5 hr bookings.
                Minimum group size is two people.

<p>
	Please remove all personal items and garbage when vacating
                rooms.

                change and you decide that you will be unable to
                attend.
	<strong>Note: A 10 minute grace period will be given for
                all room bookings and occupancy, after which time groups may
                forfeit their booking to other groups who may be waiting for a
                space to open.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To ensure equitable access to Cameron Library Group Study
                Rooms during exam periods, rules may be revised. Access to
                Group Study Rooms is to be shared by all students.Students are
                reminded that block booking of rooms is not acceptable.

                that we can continue to offer you these services.
