<strong> What a Science Literacy Week!</strong> Over the course of 19 
events (the most of any university in the country!), the entire U of A 
community showed just how passionately curious they were about all 
things science.  Hundreds of students passed by Clive Coy from the Dino 
Lab as he excavated part of the vertebral column of a duckbilled 
dinosaur, and the large audience at Janet Ng’s talk about endangered 
ferruginous hawks got up close and personal with Vinnie the peregrine 
falcon. Students had the opportunity to hear about each others research 
and work, with the students from AlbertaSat showcasing their work on the
 first Alberta-built satellite - we’re counting down to launch day!  Dr.
 Braden Barr and Danny Shpeley brought over terrific specimens, with 
passers by getting up close and personal with beetles, butterflies, 
anteaters, and pangolins.  Technology was also on full display, with 
great makerspace demos by EdTech and Cameron Library’s 3D printer 
experts! </p><p>Thank you to all who came to play with everyday chemistry, and learn 
about citizen science through gathering data on worms and plants; who 
toured up to the stars and meteorites, and dove down to the tiniest 
boson - your curiosity knows no bounds!</p><p>Biggest and most sincere thanks to our wonderful presenters!  Your 
passion for your research, and your ability and talent to share with 
students and staff was amazing!  We are all more science-smart because 
of you!</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026153351/https://www.instagram.com/uofalibraries/"><strong>Photos from the week</strong></a>

</p><p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026153351/http://scienceliteracy.ca/"><strong>Science Literacy Week</strong></a>
 is a national week-long celebration of science in Canada.  From 
September 19 to 23, 2016, University of Alberta Libraries will host a 
number of presentations, demos, and displays showcasing the diverse 
scientific research conducted by staff and students all across the 
University of Alberta.  From paleontology and particle physics, to 
citizen scientists and satellites, the breadth of knowledge and research
 is amazing!  Science Literacy Week gives students and staff the 
opportunity to get up close and personal with scientific research and 
learn what goes on behind lab room doors from those who are passionately
 curiously about their research and work.<span class="redactor-invisible-space"><br></span>
</p><p>So put on your lab coat, find your best beaker, and check out the schedule for a complete list of events. Everyone is welcome!
