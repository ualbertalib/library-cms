<strong> What a Science Literacy Week!</strong> Over the course of 19 events (the most of any university in the country!), the entire U of A community showed just how passionately curious they were about all things science.  Hundreds of students passed by Clive Coy from the Dino Lab as he excavated part of the vertebral column of a duckbilled dinosaur, and the large audience at Janet Ng’s talk about endangered ferruginous hawks got up close and personal with Vinnie the peregrine falcon. Students had the opportunity to hear about each others research and work, with the students from AlbertaSat showcasing their work on the first Alberta-built satellite - we’re counting down to launch day!  Dr. Braden Barr and Danny Shpeley brought over terrific specimens, with passers by getting up close and personal with beetles, butterflies, anteaters, and pangolins.  Technology was also on full display, with great makerspace demos by EdTech and Cameron Library’s 3D printer experts! </p>
 
<p>Thank you to all who came to play with everyday chemistry, and learn about citizen science through gathering data on worms and plants; who toured up to the stars and meteorites, and dove down to the tiniest boson - your curiosity knows no bounds!</p>

<p>Biggest and most sincere thanks to our wonderful presenters!  Your passion for your research, and your ability and talent to share with students and staff was amazing!  We are all more science-smart because of you!</p>

only passionately curious.

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161026153351/http://scienceliteracy.ca/"><strong>Science Literacy Week</strong></a> is a national week-long celebration of science in Canada.  From September 19 to 23, 2016, University of Alberta Libraries will host a number of presentations, demos, and displays showcasing the diverse scientific research conducted by staff and students all across the University of Alberta.  From paleontology and particle physics, to citizen scientists and satellites, the breadth of knowledge and research is amazing!  Science Literacy Week gives students and staff the opportunity to get up close and personal with scientific research and learn what goes on behind lab room doors from those who are passionately curiously about their research and work.<span class="redactor-invisible-space"><br></span>
</p>
<p>So put on your lab coat, find your best beaker, and check out the schedule for a complete list of events. Everyone is welcome!
