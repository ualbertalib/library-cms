<p>University of Alberta Libraries (UAL) invites faculty, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students to express their interest in acquiring commercially available data sets through the Libraries' Data Purchase Program.</p><h3>About the Program</h3><p>Access to numeric, spatial, and other forms of data produced by others can be essential for research. While Open Data is becoming more widely available, there are still many cases where data are only commercially available. To support data-dependent research better, the Libraries is piloting a demand-driven data purchase program.</p><p>Examples of data that might be considered for purchase include:</p><ul><li>spatial data, e.g., <a href="http://web.ornl.gov/sci/landscan/" target="_blank">LandScan Global Population Databases</a></li><li>resource data, e.g., <a href="http://www.aer.ca/documents/catalog/ProductCatalogue.pdf" target="_blank">Oils Sands Extraction Data</a></li><li>OCR markup from book digitization, e.g., <a href="http://news.cengage.com/library-research/gale-leads-to-advance-academic-research-by-offering-content-for-data-mining-and-textual-analysis/" target="_blank">Gale Digital Collections</a></li></ul><h3>Guidelines</h3><p>Purchased data will become part of the library collection and made available for general use by the campus community, as permitted by its license. $5,000 has been allocated for the Data Purchase Program. Amounts awarded for individual proposals will depend upon the total number and suitability of applications received at the time of review.</p><h3>Important Dates</h3><p>The review process will begin <strong>November 20th, 2016</strong> with preference given to applications arriving before <strong>the new year</strong>. Requests will be adjudicated with purchases made by <strong>March 31, 2017</strong>.</p><h3>To Apply</h3><p>Requests will be made <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7vYiiUTcELoZoDZSu5SU2-sTglaIi-SuRVqV_eTfv3v49kg/viewform?c=0&w=1" target="_blank">via an online form</a>.
