Package (AIP)

	Special processing is undertaken to prepare research data for long-term storage. An AIP can be thought of as a special digital backpack in which data are organized for preservation. The
	<a href="http://www.library.ualberta.ca/digital-initiatives/">Digital Initiatives</a> unit in our Library in collaboration with <a href="http://www.artefactual.com/">Artefactual Systems Inc.</a> in Vancouver, UBC, and SFU developed a structured AIP format for research data that can be produced by the Archivematica system.

<h4>Archivematica</h4>
<p>
	<a href="https://www.archivematica.org/wiki/Main_Page">Archivematica</a> is a digital preservation software system that ingests files, processes them employing state of the art digital preservation practices, creates and packages files in an AIP, generates metadata documenting the processing conducted in the completion of these operations, and then stores the resulting digital preservation object. This processing helps increase the long-term survival of digital content and facilitates the migration of files as format standards change.
