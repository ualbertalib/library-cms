<h3>Data Formats Glossary</h3><p><strong>File Formats</strong>: Application software typically read data in a few accepted formats. If data has been saved in another format, the Data Library can help. We provide assistance in migrating data between formats for different software.</p><p><strong>Proprietary Formats</strong>: Some file formats are protected under copyright, and their structures are not publicly released. These formats operate efficiently in their original software, but have limited use beyond it. To plan for long term use of data, save files in a non-proprietary format that is based on a publicly shared, standards-based format.</p><p><strong>Text versus non-text Formats</strong>: Data that can be read by the human eye using a text editor will be in a text format, while data that have been written using a binary variable type, for example written in double precision Real*8 format, will not be displayed as readable characters in the same editor. Non-text formats require knowledge of the record layout for data reuse.</p><p><strong>Record Layouts</strong>: A record layout is a document that describes the variety of variable formats that are used in the file and how to declare these so application software can read them.</p><p><strong>File Extension Types</strong>: A file operating system, such as Microsoft Windows, uses file extensions to help application programs identify the files they can read. For example,the extensions .xls, .xlt, .xlm, .xlsx, and .xlsm are all Microsoft Excel extensions. However, file extensions can be used for different programs; some researchers use the extension .dat to represent a text data file. Many different programs also use this same extension. For clarity, include notes on format in your data documentation.</p>
