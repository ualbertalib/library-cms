</p><h3>Take-Down Requests from Publishers</h3><p>Faculty may on occasion receive take-down requests from publishers regarding the sharing of <a href="http://www.infodocket.com/2017/10/05/report-publishers-seek-removal-of-millions-of-papers-from-researchgate">final versions of research articles online on third-party websites</a>. If this happens, please note that the Libraries offers a service to help faculty determine what versions of their articles are legally permitted for open sharing, and will also host these versions in <a href="https://era.library.ualberta.ca">ERA: Education and Research Archive</a>. Faculty can obtain an ERA Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for these versions once deposited, and use these permanent links (on third-party websites or otherwise) to direct readers to their work. For more information / to request this service, email <a href="mailto:erahelp@ualberta.ca" target="_blank">erahelp@ualberta.ca</a>.<br><br>For information about copyright and your publishing agreements, including upcoming workshops, contact the Copyright Office at <a href="mailto:copyright@ualberta.ca" target="_blank">copyright@ualberta.ca</a>.
