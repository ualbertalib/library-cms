<p><a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> is an open, non-profit organization run by and for the research community. ORCID provides researchers with a unique persistent digital researcher identifier, an ORCID iD.
</p><p>An ORCID iD<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5PnfL_z3esXvmAEcIfcet75xh8rfMopmOc8MW-RS-aiC0CdwdVwaN865SiM9rxO9G1_Xp0B-Ll3SKsqGb9lHrOl5vGHdYbi77bCOLIOA-5Z3oO21hfJWEmV6ghyX_0WrqLHYo7NC"> distinguishes individual researchers and connects them with their research contributions (e.g. articles, datasets) to ensure that their work is clearly distinguished from other researchers. With over 3.7m registered researchers, ORCID is becoming an international standard and increasingly integrated into many systems used by publishers, funders, professional associations, institutions, and other stakeholders across the research community.

</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Why you should have an ORCID iD<br></h3><p>Your ORCID iD:
</p><ol>
	<li><strong>Distinguishes you from peers</strong> with similar names and will ensure your publications, grants and other research outputs are correctly attributed to you. Others viewing your ORCID research profile such as a potential employer or funding committee will get a comprehensive and accurate profile of all of your academic achievements</li>
	<li><strong>Is a lifelong digital identifier</strong>. Your ORCID iD follows you, is managed by you, and stays with you throughout your career, even if you change your name and institutions</li>
	<li><strong>Is interoperable and reduces form-filling</strong> (“enter data once, re-use it often”). <a href="https://orcid.org/organizations/integrators/integration-chart">Many publishers, funders, and systems</a> now require submitting authors to have an ORCID iD. Your ORCID iD will save time and reduce errors by connecting systems to your record once and having it flow into the other systems. This will improve recognition and discoverability for you and your research outputs</li>
</ol><p>If integrated into existing internal and external research management systems such as the Canadian Common CV (CCV) used by the Tri Agencies, ORCID can automate the movement of research information between systems reducing manual data entry, thus minimizing the administrative burden on faculty.

</ol><h3><br></h3><h3>University of Alberta & ORCID-CA</h3><p><a href="https://orcid-ca.org">ORCID-CA</a> is the ORCID Consortium in Canada, providing member institutions with access to premium ORCID API and dedicated member support. Among one of the first Canadian institutions to join ORCID-CA, University of Alberta has been an active contributor to the Consortium and is a member on the ORCID-CA Governing Committee.
</p><p>At the University of Alberta, the following are two examples of ORCID integration efforts currently underway:
</p><ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/science">Faculty of Science</a>’s <em>Forum</em> - ORCID iDs are to be integrated into the new electronic faculty evaluation annual reporting system designed by <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/eleni-stroulia">Dr. Eleni Stroulia</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/biological-sciences">Biological Sciences Department</a> - The largest department of Faculty of Science completed Phase 1 of the department-wide ORCID iD adoption pilot project and is undergoing Phase 2 with populating profiles</li>
</ul><p>There are currently over 4000 ORCID iDs associated with a <em>ualberta.ca</em> email address. The Libraries also organize campus-wide workshops on this topic and many others. Check out our current listing of workshops <a href="https://ualberta.libcal.com/calendar/workshops">here</a>.
