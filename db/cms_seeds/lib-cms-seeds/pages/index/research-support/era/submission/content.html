<h3>
PDF/A CREATION:
</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Q: I am having trouble saving my thesis as a PDF/A.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: We recommend the following troubleshooting tips if you are having problems with PDF/A creation:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>If you are using MS Word, do not use "Save as PDF" under File - use "Save As", select PDF, then click the Options dialogue box to select PDF/A.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If MS Word is still not performing the conversion properly (a correct conversion will have a banner across the top of the file indicating so), try Adobe X or XI Pro, available in many IST Labs.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If possible and applicable, don't use the Mac versions of Word/Adobe, use PC/Windows versions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>If you are using LaTeX, this is a helpful conversion guide: <a href="http://etd.vt.edu/PDFA-1b_Tutorial_PC.pdf">http://etd.vt.edu/PDFA-1b_Tutorial_PC.pdf</a> </li>
</ul>
<h3>
ERRORS
</h3>
<p>
	<strong>Q: I saved my thesis, but I can't see it in my saved or pending items in order to access it.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: Contact the ERA HelpDesk at erahelp@ualberta.ca and leave a phone number or email where we can reach you. We will need to ask you about the status of the information in your saved record, and when we have obtained that information from you, we can restore your submission to 'pending' status.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Q: I can't see the entire submission form.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: This is likely a browser incompatibility problem with certain versions of Internet Explorer. Try another browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox and check again. If you still can't see the entire form, contact erahelp@ualberta.ca for assistance.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Q: I have not received a registration confirmation from ERA.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: This usually happens because of a typo in the email address used to register. Contact ERA's technical helpdesk at erahelp@ualberta.ca if you have not received your registration confirmation email within 2 hours of registration. Provide us with a phone number where we can reach you. We will investigate the problem and ensure you are able to successfully register.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Q: When I try to submit my thesis I get a “500 Internal Error".
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A:
</p>
<p>
	1. Try a different browser - for example, if you are using Firefox or Internet Explorer, please attempt to resubmit using Google Chrome, and vice versa. This would rule out a problem with a setting in your browser software.
</p>
<p>
	2. Try a different computer. This would rule out a problem with your computer.
</p>
<p>
	3. Try a different upload location. For example, if you are attempting your submission from home, re-attempt from campus. This would rule out a problem of bandwidth associated with your Internet Service Provider.
</p>
<p>
	If none of these approaches work, or if these are not feasible options for you, please fill out the thesis submission form completely in ERA and save it, and email your thesis to erahelp@ualberta.ca.
</p>
<p>
	Then email erahelp@ualberta.ca to notify us that you have filled out the form. We will investigate the the problem and ensure you are able to successfully submit.NOTE: THE ERA HELPDESK IS OPERATIONAL DURING REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS ONLY.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Q: When I try to submit I get this error: “The file type is invalid".</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: First, ensure that you are submitting a PDF as per the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research requirements. If the error persists, contact ERA's technical helpdesk at erahelp@ualberta.ca and report that you received this error. Attach your thesis document to your email to us and provide us with a phone number where we can reach you. We will investigate the file to determine the problem and ensure you are able to successfully submit.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Q: When I try to submit I get this error: “About field is invalid".
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: First, try a different browser - for example, if you are using Firefox or Internet Explorer, please attempt to resubmit using Google Chrome, and vice versa. This would rule out a problem with a setting in your browser software. If that does not resolve the problem, contact ERA's technical helpdesk at erahelp@ualberta.ca and report that you received this error. Provide us with a phone number where we can reach you. We will investigate the the problem and ensure you are able to successfully submit.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Q:When I try to submit I get this error: “Cannot find file".
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: Contact ERA's technical helpdesk at erahelp@ualberta.ca and report that you received this error. Provide us with a phone number where we can reach you. We will investigate the the problem and ensure you are able to successfully submit.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Q: I can't see the entire form, and so I can't fill out the required fields.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: Try a different browser, preferably Firefox, Google Chrome, or a recent version of Internet Explorer. Contact ERA's technical helpdesk aterahelp@ualberta.ca if the problem persists.
</p>
<p>

STATUS OF SUBMISSION
</h3>
<p>
	<strong>
	Q: How long will it take the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research to process my thesis submission? What is the status of my submission? Why haven't I heard anything about my submission yet?
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	A: All questions about the processing status of submissions should be directed to Program Services at the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research. See this website for contact details:

</p>
<p>
