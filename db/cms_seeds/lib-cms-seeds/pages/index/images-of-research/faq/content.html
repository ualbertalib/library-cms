     Frequently Asked Questions
    </h2>
    <p>
Thank you for your interest in the Images of Research competition. We are excited to provide this opportunity for graduate students at the UofA. Below are general questions that have been asked in the past:
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>I am an undergraduate student in my last year of studies and doing original research for my honours thesis. Am I eligible to apply?</strong></p>
              <p>No, the competition is only open to current graduate students. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We suggest that undergraduate students looking to showcase their research on campus check out the <a href="http://www.uri.ualberta.ca/">Undergraduate Research Initiative</a>, which hosts the Festival of Undergraduate Research & Creative Activities (FURCA) annually. UAL is exploring opportunities to celebrate undergraduate work in the future. Undergraduates are also welcome and encouraged to deposit their research into <a href="https://era.library.ualberta.ca/">ERA</a>.

        <p>
          <strong>Is there a limit to the number of images I can submit?
          </strong>
        </p>
              <p>Yes, only one image per person can be submitted. 
         </p><br />
    
        
        <p>
          <strong>Can the image be from research done at a previous university?
          </strong>
        </p>
              <p>No, the image must represent University of Alberta research.
         </p><br />
    

    
        
        <p>
          <strong>Can I submit an image from previous graduate work done at the UofA?
          </strong>
      </p>
              <p>If you have graduated from your program and are no longer a graduate student then unfortunately, you are ineligible. If you have entered into a new program (e.g. gone from a Master's to Doctorate program at the UofA) you must submit on your most current research. 
         </p><br />
    
            <p>
          <strong>  I applied last year. Can I resubmit?   
    

          </strong>
        </p>
              <p>Yes, but you <strong>must</strong> submit a new image, title, and description. Images that have been submitted in previous years will not be accepted. However, the new image can originate from the same research. Previous top 3, Honourable Mentions, and Peopleâ€™s Choice winners are ineligible.
         </p><br /><br />
                    <p>
          <strong>Can I get help with technical questions? For example, how do I set my image to be 300 dpi?
          </strong></p>
   <p>
     
    There are workshops to help you prepare for submission. <br />There is a session on  <a href="https://ualberta.libcal.com/event/3444399">January 17 </a>and  <a href="https://ualberta.libcal.com/event/3444403">January 24.</a></p>
<br />
           


    
    
            <p><br />
          <strong>Are there examples of Images of Research I can look at to get a better idea?
          </strong>  </p>
