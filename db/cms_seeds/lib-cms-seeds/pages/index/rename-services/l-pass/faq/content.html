	<li><strong>Q: What is the L-Pass (Library Pass) service?</strong>

Anyone registered for the L-Pass can access all services currently available to any EPL card holder, including online resources, inter-library loans, books, magazines and much more.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: Is there a cost for the L-Pass?</strong>
	A: There is no cost. The University of Alberta Libraries is providing this service in partnership with EPL.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Q: Can anyone register for the L-Pass?</strong>
	A: Most current University of Alberta students and staff are eligible to register for the L-Pass.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I am a Faculty of Extension student. Can I register for the L-Pass?</strong>
	A: In general, students registered only in Faculty of Extension courses are not eligible for the L-Pass. Campus Computing IDs (CCIDs) and library privileges vary by Faculty of Extension program. Please see <a href="/services/library-cards-and-borrowing/extension-students" data-no-turbolink="true"><strong>Extension Student Library Cards</strong></a> for more information. <a href="http://www.epl.ca/membership-benefits/"><strong>Regular EPL memberships</strong></a><strong></strong> are available at any branch of the Edmonton Public Library.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I work at the University of Alberta. Can I register for the L-Pass?</strong>
	A: University of Alberta staff are  eligible for this service.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I'm a current student but I already have an EPL library card. Can I still get the L-Pass?</strong>
	A: Yes. Existing EPL card holders can register for the L-Pass through the University of Alberta Libraries' <a href="/services/l-pass" data-no-turbolink="true"><strong>L-Pass registration</strong></a><strong></strong> website. The barcode on your ONEcard will be applied to a new EPL account. This means that while a student at the University of Alberta, you will use the barcode on your ONEcard to access EPL services -- not your existing EPL library card.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I am a University of Alberta student and I already have a <a href="http://www.thealbertalibrary.ab.ca/services/talCard.html">TAL card</a> (The Alberta Library). Can I still use the L-Pass?</strong>
	A: Yes. You can still use your TAL card at all participating library systems in Alberta. The TAL card does not, however, provide access to all available EPL services and the L-Pass does.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I have outstanding charges on my existing EPL account. Can I still register for the L-Pass?</strong>
	A: Yes.
	</li>
</ul><h3>Registration</h3><ul class="indent">

	A: It's simple.

Once registered, the barcode on your ONEcard will serve as your access to Edmonton Public Library services, online and in person.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: What if I lose my OneCard and/or get a replacement OneCard for any reason?</strong>
	A: Please report your lost L-pass registered OneCard to <a href="http://www.epl.ca"><strong>Edmonton Public Library</strong></a> as soon as possible. You will need to talk to an Edmonton Public Library staff member to reactivate your L-pass on your replacement OneCard.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: Do I have to register for this service each year?</strong>
	A: Yes. Your L-Pass will expire each year on September 30th for staff and students registered in the previous school year (September - August). You can register 40 days before your account expires or anytime after it expires provided you are still a student or staff member at the University of Alberta. For example, a current student registering for the L-Pass on November 20, 2014, will have an expiry date of September 30, 2015.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I am registered in the winter session and will continue my studies in the fall. Do I have access to EPL services during spring and summer sessions?</strong>
	A: Yes. L-Pass accounts for all current students will expire on September 30th.
	</li>
	<li><strong>Q: Why do I need to give my personal information to the Edmonton Public Library to obtain an L-Pass?</strong>

	<li><strong>Q: I am an existing EPL library card holder. Can I re-use my existing PIN with this service?</strong>
