<h4>Use your ONEcard to borrow library materials</h4><p>
	U of Calgary BSW students receive a ONEcard which we manually register in the Library user database before the beginning of term. If you find that your card has not been registered, please <a href="http://guides.library.ualberta.ca/social-work" target="_blank">contact the Social Work Librarian</a>.
