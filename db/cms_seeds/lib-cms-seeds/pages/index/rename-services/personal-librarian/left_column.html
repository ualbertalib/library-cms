<h2>What is the Personal Librarian Program? </h2><p>
	The University of Alberta Libraries are excited to offer a program called the 
	<strong>Personal Librarian Program</strong>. In the Personal Librarian Program, all self-identified first-year Aboriginal students and international students will have their very own Personal Librarian who can help them access the many services and resources the libraries have to offer.
</p><p>
	The Personal Librarian program is introduced to students via email. Following the program introduction, the students then receive information on who their Personal Librarian is, as well as their contact information. Throughout the academic year, these students will also receive short emails with tips on how to use the library.
</p><h2>How Can Your Personal Librarian Help? </h2><p>
	Finding good information will be key to your success as a student, and this is where your UAlberta libraries come in! We assist students with various aspects of their research and class assignments. For example,
</p><ul>
	<li>finding required readings for your classes</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li>finding books and articles for your papers</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li>really â€¦ anything!</li>
</ul><p>
	Whether you are looking for an engineering textbook, a music score, or ways to incorporate traditional knowledge into your assignments, your Personal Librarian will be there to assist you!
