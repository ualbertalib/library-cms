<h2>Background of the Program </h2>
<p>
	The University of Alberta Libraries are excited to offer a support service called the Personal Librarian. For the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 school years this initiative was directed towards self-identified first-year Aboriginal/FNMI Students. In 2016-2017, the program expanded to include  first-year international students. Watch here for more information as the project continues to develop!
