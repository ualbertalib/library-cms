<h3>About the Student Library Advisory Committee</h3><p>U of A Libraries created the Student Library Advisory Committee (SLAC) so it could better engage with students and improve their library experience. Committee members are asked to provide feedback on library services and programs, and have the chance to raise issues and share suggestions with the Libraries. In turn, they serve as library ambassadors to their campus communities.
</p><p>Committee membership is open to all current undergraduate, graduate, and international students at U of A. The committee meets once a month throughout the school year.
</p><p>Over<a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/slac/past/" data-no-turbolink="true"> the past few years</a> SLAC has helped the Libraries make key decisions relating to:
