<h3>The Human Library</h3>
<p>
	Years ago, in Copenhagen, Denmark, there was a young and idealistic youth organization called Stop The Violence. This non-governmental youth movement was initiated by five young people; they came together after a mutual friend was stabbed in 1993. The brutal attack on their friend, who luckily survived, made the five youth decide to try and do something about racial violence. Raising awareness and using peer group education to mobilize Danish youth, the organization soon had 30,000 members all over the country.
</p>
<p>
	In 2000 Stop The Violence was encouraged by Leif Skov, a music festival organizer, to arrange activities for Roskilde Festival, Denmark's largest annual music experience. The hope was that this event would put a spotlight on anti-violence, encourage dialogue, and build relations among the festival visitors. Stop The Violence came up with the idea of having people meet face-to-face with their own stereotypes and prejudices in one-on-one conversations. From this the Human Library was born and became a challenge to the crowds of Northern Europe's biggest summer festival.
</p>
<p>
	Since its humble beginnings in Denmark the Human Library concept has spread across central Europe and around the world. The Council of Europe promotes the Human Library concept with a handbook 
	<a href="http://living-library.org/assets/files/guides/Living%20Lib%20Organisers%20Guide.pdf">The Human Library Organizer's Guide</a> now available in eight languages. Since 2000, Human Library events have occurred in Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, England, Ukraine, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Belgium, Austria, Poland, Serbia, Spain, Netherlands, Scotland, United States, Canada, New Zealand, Romania and Lithuania.
</p>
<p>
	In nine years the Human Library concept has evolved from one program at one event to a world-wide experience connecting people and building bridges. Human Books may now be checked out at special events such as folk and music festivals, from public libraries, and from university and college libraries.
</p>
<p>
	The 
	<strong>augustana human library</strong> joins a long and growing list of organizations interested in promoting understanding and compassion between people where prejudice and stereotyping have created misunderstanding and division.
