<h3>What is a <strong>Human Book</strong>?</h3>
<p>
	Human Books are people who have experienced prejudice or stereotyping or very significant life experiences; they are open about who they are and are prepared to share their stories. Human Books have made themselves available for Readers to listen, learn and understand what they have always wanted to know about the Human Books' topics.
</p>
<p>
	For example, a Human Book could be a person who has lived in a war zone and has chosen "War Survivor" as their title. This Human Book could share the physical and emotional trauma of living in the midst of war and how it has impacted their life. Furthermore, they may share their perceptions of how others see them: the prejudice or stereotyping they may have experienced. The Reader of this Human Book would have opportunities to ask questions about the Human Book's story.
</p>
<h3>What is a <strong>Human Library</strong>?</h3>
<p>
	A Human Library provides an opportunity for Readers to borrow a Human Book for a given time and to hear their story. The Augustana Library offered Alberta's first university-based Human Library. It is the aim of the augustana human library to create a space where individuals may directly engage with those who have experienced prejudice or other significant challenges, for the sake of growing compassion and understanding.
</p>
<h3>A Human Library <strong>is</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>an opportunity to speak with a Human Book in a structured, protected, private yet completely free space within a limited time</li>
	<li>a place to tell your story</li>
	<li>a tool to foster peaceful cohabitation and to bring people closer together in mutual and careful respect for the human dignity of the individual</li>
	<li>a place that enables the Readers to focus and reflect upon their own prejudices and stereotypes, and to establish a peaceful, positive meeting with one's prejudices</li>
	<li>a place to learn about experiences which are foreign to you, about which you are curious</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Human Library <strong>is not</strong>:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>a public relations exercise looking for spectacular headlines</li>
	<li>a zoo or display case for rare and exotic species</li>
	<li>a job recruitment agency or a place to exhibit famous people</li>
	<li>a forum for promoting a religious, political or ideological agenda</li>
	<li>an occasion to discuss problems, frustrations or other emotions related to experiences beyond a Human Book topic</li>
</ul>
