<h3>2010 Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Instruction Section (IS) Innovation Award</h3>
<p>
	Nancy Goebel, head librarian, and Dylan Anderson, Web applications specialist, at the University of Alberta Augustana Campus have been selected to receive the 2010 Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) 
	<a href="http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/awards/achievementawards/innovationaward.cfm">Instruction Section (IS) Innovation Award</a> for developing <a href="http://www.library.ualberta.ca/augustana/infolit/wassail/">WASSAIL</a>, an information literacy assessment project.
</p>
<p>
	"The Instruction Section Awards committee chose the 
	<a href="http://www.library.ualberta.ca/augustana/infolit/wassail/">WASSAIL</a> information literacy assessment project for the ACRL Instruction Section Innovation Award because of the creators' forward-thinking approach to assessing student learning locally and sharing methods universally," <a href="http://www.acrl.ala.org/acrlpress/?p=116" target="_blank">said award committee Co-Chair Emily Rogers</a>, assistant professor and reference librarian for instruction at Valdosta State University. "Using this software, librarians can systematically track, store and analyze assessment data to measure and improve student learning. Furthermore, in a truly collaborative spirit, the project planners expanded WASSAIL's utility by making it open source and therefore available for local adaptation by any library. In its purpose, content and potential for widespread use, <a href="http://www.library.ualberta.ca/augustana/infolit/wassail/">WASSAIL</a> is truly an innovative contribution to information literacy and instruction librarianship."

<h3>2010 Innovation and Technology Award for WASSAIL Programming</h3>
<p>
	Augustana Campus Web Applications Specialist Dylan Anderson was named one of two winners of this year's 
	<em>University of Alberta Information Technology and Innovation Awards</em>, as announced by the office of the Vice-Provost in April, 2010. This award is given to those projects demonstrating innovative use of technology in support of research, teaching, administration or the campus experience. Dylan's contributions to WASSAIL met the award committee's considerations for the impact of the innovation, the size of the community affected and the novelty of the idea. WASSAIL is no longer only a local concept, for as Dylan states, “When we built WASSAIL, I thought it was just something Augustana wanted – I didn't realize it was something the world wanted!"
