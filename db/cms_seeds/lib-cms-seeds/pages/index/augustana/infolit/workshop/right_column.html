	Sharon Mader is the ACRL Visiting Program Officer for Information Literacy, whose primary responsibility is to spearhead the launch and implementation of the 
	<em>ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education</em>. Dr. Mader retired in early 2015 after fifteen years as Dean of Library Services at the University of New Orleans, after a rewarding career at a variety of public and private academic libraries, including University of Illinois Health Sciences, Lake Forest College, DePaul University, and University of Memphis. Her teaching background includes service as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Tunisia and being a founding faculty member of the ACRL Immersion program.
</p><p>
	Her professional activities include leadership roles in state, national, and international library associations, including the ACRL Instruction Section and most recently, as a member of the ACRL Standards for Libraries in Higher Education professional development training team and as chair of the IFLA Information Literacy Section.
</p><p>
	Her educational background includes a BA in History from Oberlin College, an MLS from Rosary College, an MS in Education from University of Memphis, and an Ed.D. in Instructional Technology and Distance Education from Nova Southeastern University.
</p><p>
	Recent information literacy-related endeavors include co-authoring the 
	<em>IFLA Media and Information Literacy (MIL) Recommendations</em> which were endorsed by the UNESCO General Conference in November 2013, and presenting a paper on "Using Threshold Concepts to Improve Information Literacy and Scholarly Communication Competencies of Doctoral Students" at the 2nd European Conference on Information Literacy in Dubrovnik, Croatia (October 2014).
</p><span rel="color: #e19024;" style="color: #e19024;"><strong>Workshop Abstract</strong></span><br><p>
	Is life just the same now that the Framework is here as it was before? Do you think differently about information literacy and have you changed what you do? What is different about the Framework, and where can it take us? How does the Framework redefine the roles of librarians, teaching faculty, and students?
</p><p>
	During this workshop, participants will explore and expand their understanding of the Framework and its essential foundations of conceptual understandings (essential questions and threshold concepts), metaliteracy, and the scholarship of teaching and learning.
</p><p>
	Together we will consider Framework implementation examples and experiments that illustrate ways of engaging in deeper conversations about teaching and learning, cultivating collaborations, and contributing to change in the classroom, at our institutions, and across higher education.
</p><p>
	Through workshop discussions and exercises, participants will take away a toolkit for a student learning framework that they can adapt for their own institutional settings.
