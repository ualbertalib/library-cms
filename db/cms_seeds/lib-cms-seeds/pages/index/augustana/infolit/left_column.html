As such, the Library is guided by the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education, as set by the Association of College &amp; Research Libraries (ACRL), which state:</p><p>Information literacy forms the basis for lifelong learning. It is common to all disciplines, to all learning environments, and to all levels of education. It enables learners to master content and extend their investigations, become more self-directed, and assume greater control over their own learning. An information literate individual is able to:</p><ul class="arrows">
