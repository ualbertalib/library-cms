</p><p>
		Dr. Yvonne Becker is an Associate Professor of Physical Education and Women's Studies. Yvonne has promoted information literacy (IL) in her classes for many years and took it a step higher recently by incorporating this work into several scholarly presentations. At the American Library Association conference held in Las Vegas (June 2014), she presented two papers. The first was "Her Voice Was Heard: Undergraduate Women's Studies Students Compare Narrative and Traditional Scholarly Resources in their Research", and the second was titled, "Women's Studies and Human Books: A Valuable Information Literacy Experiment". These two papers as well as another titled "Voices and Words: Using Human Books and Scholarly Articles to Understand Gender and Sexuality" presented at this year's Congress Conference at Brock University, drew upon Augustana's IL initiative called the Human Library. Yvonne's papers provided national and international recognition and promotion of IL at Augustana. Back in the classroom, Yvonne's practice of having her students use Human Books as resources (including citing them) was innovative and challenged students to learn and engage with topics in ways beyond more traditional assignments.  These accomplishments, along with her long standing practice of incorporating additional IL elements in course assignments led her teaching colleagues to nominate her for this award, and subsequently convinced the award committee of her suitability as this year's winner.

		Dr. Shauna Wilton's strong commitment to undergraduate teaching &amp; learning is evident in her ongoing collaboration with librarians to address information literacy in the various Political Studies courses that she teaches. The nomination for this award, submitted by an Augustana student, included the following statement: "Professor Wilton maintains an on-going relationship with the library and its resources and strongly encourages her students to do the same." Dr. Wilton continues to seek ways to develop information literacy within the context of Political Studies. Accordingly, she has collaborated with librarians in the design of a new course, Political Studies 200, which will be a required course for all Political Studies students at Augustana. This course will introduce students to the research process and various methodological approaches within political studies, while helping students to develop research and information literacy skills. Topics included in the course will include research design and communication, quantitative and qualitative methods, exploring and assessing sources of information, as well as information literacy.

</p><p>
		Dr. Milton Schlosser is a professor of music and an accomplished pianist, composer, and teacher. He has been an information literacy partner with the Augustana librarians for many years. Specifically, he was critical to the foundation of Augustana's IL program by his unwavering support for the creation of a credit IL course in music. He was a strong advocate of the course not only in conversations with the librarians, but with the administration and in faculty meetings. A successful IL program must have genuine faculty support to succeed. Dr. Schlosser was, at the beginning, our strongest and most vocal supporter.
</p><p>
		Dr. Schlosser promoted the IL initiatives of the library as an essential component of Augustana's mission by his insistence that the music IL course be mandatory for all music majors. This was, and continues to be, a strong indication to both internal and external stakeholders of how valuable he believes the music IL course to be for our curriculum.
</p><p>
		Dr. Schlosser also promoted the success of the music IL course to other faculty which helped to bolster the development of additional IL course across many disciplines.

</p><p>
		Dr. Dave “Doc" Larson is a Biology faculty member who is a strong advocate of Augustana's information literacy initiatives. He has always placed strong emphasis on the importance of library research skills in his courses. Over the years, Doc has routinely invited librarians to guest lecture in his classes to teach students the most current approaches and strategies for effective library research.
</p><p>
		Doc has often commented on the marked improvement he has observed in student research papers as a result of Augustana's information literacy initiatives. The Augustana librarians are fortunate to have faculty members like Doc who place such a high value on teaching library research skills to undergraduate students.

</p><p>
			Dr. Marentette is a Psychology faculty member who has worked closely with Augustana Librarians for over a decade. She was one of the first to fully embrace faculty-librarian collaboration to integrate innovative and challenging library research assignments into her courses. Her recognition of the value of integrating IL initiatives into her courses has made a significant and lasting impact on many Augustana students. Dr. Marentette's courses are known by students as courses infused with high demands and library research integration. Dr. Marentette is a strong supporter of the 21 for-credit discipline-specific Information Literacy courses in Augustana's curriculum; her advocacy has been an important component of the success of this model in this context.
