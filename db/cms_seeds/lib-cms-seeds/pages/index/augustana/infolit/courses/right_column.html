	The Augustana Campus Library has offered library instruction sessions for many years. Since the late 1990's the deliberate integration of information literacy (IL) principles into these sessions has been significantly enhanced. The introduction of discipline specific credit bearing IL courses in the fall of 2001 saw Augustana's IL initiatives take a significant leap forward. Augustana recently adopted three <a href="http://www.augustana.ualberta.ca/programs/curriculum.html">core skills for graduates</a>: Thinkers, Researchers, and Communicators. Information literacy is an integral component of the Researcher skill. Since the introduction of the new curriculum core, Augustana's librarians have begun to work with teaching faculty to re-examine how IL is integrated across all disciplines at all levels, exploring ways to reach as many students as possible. Some disciplines have opted to keep the credit courses as their prime method of IL integration, while others have chosen different means. Regardless of the method, librarians and teaching faculty continue to collaborate with the mutual objective of providing Augustana students with highly relevant and practical IL education.

	Corequisites
</h3><p>
	Students taking a discipline-specific IL course at Augustana Campus are encouraged to be enrolled in a corequisite course, whose major paper will form the basis of most of their assignments in the IL course. A suitable corequisite is a course in the same discipline as the IL course in which significant library research (e.g. term paper) is required. Ideally, the corequisite is taken in the same term as the IL course. To determine the suitability of a course as corequisite for an IL course students are encouraged to inquire with the relevant instructor.
