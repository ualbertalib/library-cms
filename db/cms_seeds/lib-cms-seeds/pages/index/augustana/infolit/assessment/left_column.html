<h3>Assessment</h3>

	By implementing a multi-pronged approach to Augustana’s IL credit course evaluation, Augustana's librarians seek to gain as much information as possible about the impact of the IL courses on student learning and on student attitudes toward library research.
</p>
<p>
	To assess student learning in the credit courses, Augustana has implemented a number of what Lindauer (2004) terms “performance-based” assessment methods including pretests/post-tests, course assignments, and tests. In addition to course assessment, students who receive any type of librarian-taught BI or IL instruction in other Augustana courses are asked to complete a survey about their perceptions of the content and value of the session. The Augustana librarians are also evaluated by students in the IL credit courses.
</p>
<p>
	Our research into the area of IL assessment is fueled by “institutional curiosity." In keeping with Maki’s (2002) definition, we are seeking “answers to questions about which students learn, what they learn, how well they learn, and when they learn […].”<br>
	<br>
	The Augustana Library's online assessment tool is called <a href="http://www.library.ualberta.ca/augustana/infolit/wassail/index.cfm">WASSAIL</a>.<br>

	<strong>Pre-tests and Post-Tests</strong>
</p>
<div>
	Pre-tests and post-tests are administered as part of Augustana Library’s ongoing assessment examining the impact of our Information Literacy courses on student learning. The objective of the pre- and post-testing is to measure students’ information literacy skills prior to the course and upon completion of the course in order to measure the impact of the course on the development of these skills. <br>
	<br>
	During the first class students complete the multiple choice test. In addition to gathering demographic data, students are asked how they perceive the current success of their research (library, Web, catalogue, databases, etc.). An identical test is then administered post-course. All test data is compiled into WASSAIL and reports generated to analyze areas of strength and weakness prior to and after course instruction.
