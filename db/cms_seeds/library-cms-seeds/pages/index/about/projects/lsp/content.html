<h1>Library Services Platform Migration</h1>
<div class="row">
  
<div class="col-md-11">
<h3>In July 2025, the University of Alberta Library introduced a new way for our students, faculty and staff to search and find library resources.</h3>

<p>For decades, we have collaborated with the <a href="https://neoslibraries.ca/member-libraries/">NEOS Consortium</a> to maintain a shared catalogue, enabling the exchange of resources, collections, and processes. However, due to evolving technology and other factors, this arrangement is no longer sustainable. To stay current with technological advancements and better serve our patrons, the University of Alberta Library is transitioning to a new generation of library software, which will allow us to:</p>

<ul>
    <li class="pb-2">Enhance access to University of Alberta Library materials</li>
    <li class="pb-2">Expand the discoverability of and access to library collections</li>
    <li class="pb-2">Offer features aligned with a modern technological experience</li>
    <li class="pb-2">Present print and electronic formats in a user-friendly manner</li>
    <li class="pb-2">Explore new ways of sharing resources and collaborating in the future</li>
</ul>

  <h2>How Does This Change Impact Me?</h2>
  <h3>Upcoming Library Service Disruptions</h3>
<p>The following services will be temporarily paused or unavailable as the library prepares for the LSP system migration and launch on <strong>July 16</strong>. Please refer to the scheduled outage dates below for details. If you have any questions or need assistance, please <a href="/ask-us">ask us</a>.</p>

  <div class="col-md-10 ms-4">
    

<h4 class="mb-0">May 23, 2025</h4>

<ul>
  
<li><h5 class="mb-0 mt-2">Library catalogue updates and addition of new materials</h5>
  Starting on May 23, library cataloguing activity will be temporarily paused in preparation for migration. No new materials will be added to the collection. During this time, the library catalogue may be slightly inaccurate, especially for e-resources.</li>


<li><h5 class="mb-0 mt-2">Course materials and reading list review services</h5>
  The cataloguing pause may limit the availability of some course materials and could impact Summer Term courses. The library’s reading list review services (<a href="https://ualberta.rl.ca.talis.com/index.html">Talis Aspire</a>) will also be suspended until after launch on July 16.</li>  </ul>
    <h4 class="mb-0">June 23, 2025</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
   Registration for Alumni e-Resources suspended until further notice</li>  </ul>
<h4 class="mb-0">July 7, 2025</h4>

   <ul>
     <li><h5 class="mb-0 mt-2">Holds and Interlibrary Loans</h5>
       Library users will be temporarily unable to place holds on University of Alberta materials or request items from other libraries through Interlibrary Loans (ILL). During this time, you will still be able to borrow and pick-up items directly from the library location that has your desired item. You will not be able to request to have items transferred to a different location for pick-up as book transfers will not be operating. Items that are currently held at the Research &amp; Collections Resource Facility (RCRF) and Bibliothèque Saint-Jean will not be available. </li> </ul>

 
    
<h4 class="mb-0">July 11, 2025</h4>
 

 <ul>
   <li><h5 class="mb-0 mt-2">Library self-checkout options</h5>
     If you wish to check out an item after July 11, you will need to do this at a library service desk where a staff member will manually sign out the material for you. You will not be able to use the self-checkout kiosks or the MeeScan app until after July 16.</li>  </ul>


   <ul>
   <li><h5 class="mb-0 mt-2">My Account</h5>
     For a short period of time, you will not be able to access your University of Alberta library account. Any fee payments and account inquiries may be addressed before July 11 or after July 16.</li></ul>
    
    <ul>
   <li><h5 class="mb-0 mt-2">Holds (Unfilled)</h5>
     Your active holds that have not been filled yet (ie. are not yet ready for you to pick up on the holds shelf) unfortunately can't be transferred to our new system. You will receive an automatic notice informing you that they have been cancelled in the current system, and if they are still needed, you will be able to place them again in the new system after July 16.</li></ul>
    
 <h4 class="mb-1">July 15, 2025</h4>
   <ul>   
     <li>
      Cameron, Rutherford, Sperber Libraries close at 4pm in preparation for Go-Live.</li> </ul>  
<h4 class="mb-0">July 16, 2025</h4>

   <ul>
  <li><h5 class="mb-0 mt-2">New Library Services Platform is launched!</h5>
    You will be able to start using the new library search tool and My Account. Our staff will be working hard to make sure everything in the new system is working correctly, and there may be some additional minor disruptions during the post-launch period.</li></ul>
  </div>
 
        <h3>Search Interface and Library My Account</h3>
  <p>The Library Services Platform (LSP) project will update the Library’s search interface and Library Account, changing how you find and access resources, as well as manage your interactions with the Library. We’ve consulted with the Student Library Advisory Committee and will continue gathering student feedback on key user impact decisions. Usability testing with end users will take place both before and after go-live to ensure continuous improvement. The new interfaces will be more intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible, making it easier to find materials, access content, and navigate various resources, all with the goal of enhancing your overall experience. These changes are ongoing, and more focused communication and detailed information will be shared as it becomes available. Your MyEBSCO account will remain active; however, you may lose access to records you have saved.</p>
  <h3>Google Scholar Library Links</h3>
<p>To access University of Alberta resources using Google Scholar, you will be required to update the U of A Library link in your Google Scholar settings. Detailed instructions will be available after July 16.</p>
<p>
           <h3>Permalink Change</h3>
  <p>A permalink is a persistent URL that provides direct access to library resources, including full-text articles and catalog records. After July 16, permalinks from the current search interface will no longer be valid. To avoid manual updates in syllabi and reading lists, faculty can use Talis Aspire, which integrates with Canvas and updates automatically. For non-course materials (e.g., bookmarks, LibGuides, web pages) or if faculty choose not to use Talis Aspire, permalinks must be updated manually after the system launch. Updates will be sent via Academic Digest and faculty communication channels, with detailed instructions and an FAQ available on the library website.</p>
  <h3>Changes to NEOS Shared Borrowing</h3>
<p>NEOS items will no longer show in catalogue search results. If you're interested in viewing the collections of a NEOS library, please visit their library website.</p>  
  
<p>
<ul>
    <li class="pb-2">Checked out items from these libraries will not be renewable and will need to be returned by the due date.</li>
  <li class="pb-2">If you wish to access items from these libraries, please request them through our <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/services/interlibrary-loan">Interlibrary Loan service</a>, or <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/recommend_purchase/index.php">recommend a purchase</a> (CCID required) for the University of Alberta Library.</li>
    <li class="pb-2">NEOS library locations have been removed from our system and can't be used as a general pickup location for your holds.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you have any questions or concerns about the items you have borrowed or access to those collections, please <a href="/ask-us">ask us</a>.</p>
