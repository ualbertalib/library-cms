<h1>Access to Library Electronic Resources</h1>


<p>
The University of Alberta Library licenses a wide range of electronic journals, ebooks, research databases, streaming audio and video, and many other types of eresources from commercial vendors. These licenses restrict the remote use of these resources to currently affiliated students, faculty, and staff of the University, who possess a current Campus Computing ID (CCID). 
</p>
<p>
  However, most electronic resource licenses do permit walk-in/on-campus use by guests and the wider community at public computer workstations within the campus Libraries, or via the UofA wireless network (UWS).
</p>
<p>
Special conditions of use for individual databases are indicated on the <a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/az.php?">A-Z Databases list</a> using the symbols below:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><img src="https://sites.library.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ccid.png" alt="CCID Required" /> Use of this product is restricted to students, faculty, and staff of the University of Alberta, and requires login with a current CCID.</li>
  <li><img src="https://sites.library.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/reg.png"  alt="Registration Required"/>Use of this product is restricted to students, faculty, and staff of the University of Alberta, and requires first-time users to create an individual registration. When registering for access to Library databases, please use your University of Alberta email address.</li>
  <li><img src="https://sites.library.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/open.png"  alt="Open Access"/>This is an Open Access resource and is not licensed by the University of Alberta Library. The content of this database is open to all users, both on campus and remotely.</li>

<h2>PRIMARY CCIDs (Current U of A students, faculty and staff)</h2>
<p>
	<a href="/services/off-campus-access">Remote access</a> (from outside the University computing network) to library licensed online resources by primary members of the University community (current students, faculty and staff) requires login to the Library's proxy server using a personal <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/information-services-and-technology/services/ccid-passwords/index.html" target="_blank">Campus Computing ID (CCID)</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Information Services &amp; Technology (IST). For more information about use of the University’s information technology, see the <a href="https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Information-Technology-Use-and-Management-Policy.pdf">Information Technology Use and Management Policy</a>.
</p>
<p>
Individuals with CCIDs who are no longer current students, faculty, or staff (with the exception of Professors Emeriti) will not have remote access to library eresources.
</p>
<p>
	Problems logging in to the proxy server should be reported using the following 
	<a href="/ask-us/report-problem">web form</a>.

<h2>TEMPORARY CAMPUS COMPUTING IDs</h2>
<p>
	Temporary Campus Computing IDs (Temporary CCIDs) are issued by U of A faculties/departments to those without a primary affiliation but who maintain a “direct benefit" relationship to the University of Alberta (e.g. <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/research/research-support/academic-visitor-office/resources-for-academic-visitors.html">academic visitors</a>, AASUA/NASA staff).
</p>
<p>
	Those with Temporary CCIDs will have on-campus access to library online resources via library computers, computers in campus offices or labs, or via the University of Alberta wireless network but will <strong>not</strong> have off-campus access to these resources.
</p>
<p>
	Temporary CCIDs must be renewed by the sponsoring department, normally, on an annual basis.
	For more information on Guest CCIDs look under “Commonly Asked Questions” for:  
	<a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/information-services-and-technology/services/ccid-passwords/index.html" target="_blank">I’m a guest at the university, how do I get a CCID?</a>
</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="temp">LIBRARY NETWORK ACCESS IDs</h2>
<p>
	Those without a current primary or guest relationship to the University of Alberta (e.g. members of the general public, students from other educational institutions) may access U of A Library resources <strong>on-campus</strong> using a Library Network Access ID.
</p>
<p>

<h2>Network Security</h2><p>Security is a top priority for the campus information technology community. To ensure the security of our networked services, the University of Alberta Library requires authentication for the use of all public workstations.
</p><p>What does this mean in practice? Through the public workstations, patrons can search and navigate the Library website and catalogue without authenticating. However, when you leave the Library domain to access databases, ejournals or other Internet resources, you are required to authenticate with a CCID or Library Network Access ID. It will be important that you remember to close the browser and logout when you are done to prevent your ID being used by the next person who uses the workstation.
</p><p>CCIDs are issued to the University's faculty, staff and students by IST.
