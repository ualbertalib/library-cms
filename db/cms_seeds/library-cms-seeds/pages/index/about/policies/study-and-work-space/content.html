<h1>Study and Work Space Policies </h1>
<p>The Library is a place for learning. People need quiet places to learn and work as well as spaces for group learning and collaboration. The Library is also a centre for teaching, where library staff instruct individuals and groups in the use of information resources and materials. To create an environment that meets the study and work needs of our community, we have established zones in the library to suit varying types of study:
