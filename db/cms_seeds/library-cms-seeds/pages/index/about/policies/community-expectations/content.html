  Welcome! The Library is here to support you. We know that everyone uses the library for different reasons and in different ways. In keeping with the <a href="/about/vision" data-no-turbolink="true">Library’s Vision and Priorities</a>, we provide open and responsive services, collections, and spaces to meet the needs of our user communities.
</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">
<p><strong>We will:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>respect all library users and commit to working with you to maintain a culture of scholarship, open academic inquiry, respect, tolerance, and inclusivity in a safe and secure environment.
	</li>
	<li>provide equitable access to a diverse range of library materials and services.
	</li>
	<li>provide space for research, collaborative and interactive learning, and quiet, personal study.
	</li>
	<li>respond to issues that arise in the library in collaboration with campus partners such as ONEcard, Student Connect, Facilities &amp; Operations, University of Alberta Protective Services, etc. 
	</li>
	<li>collaborate with other libraries across Alberta and beyond to support you in your research and information needs.
	</li>
	<li>protect each library user’s right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted, in alignment with the <a href="https://www.ala.org/tools/ethics">American Library Association’s Code of Ethics</a> and that of the <a href="http://cfla-fcab.ca/en/guidelines-and-position-papers/code-of-ethics/">Canadian Federation of Library Association’s Code of Ethics</a>.</li>
