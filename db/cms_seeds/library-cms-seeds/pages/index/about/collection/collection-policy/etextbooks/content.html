<p>The University of Alberta Library has been e-preferred for many years and supports instructors in choosing textbooks with online options, in order to increase accessibility for their students. Unfortunately, student access is hampered by textbook publishers who do not provide electronic purchasing options for libraries. <strong>Approximately 57% of existing University of Alberta course textbooks are simply unavailable to the Library in any format other than print.*</strong> Some publishers, such as Pearson, are also moving away from print textbooks, making it impossible for the Library to provide access to their textbooks at all. Textbook publishers have built their business models around selling e-textbooks directly to students. Despite this, we also know that the cost of textbooks and other course materials are a major financial concern for students and staff at the University of Alberta.</p>

<p class="mb-1">Despite the Library’s commitment to make copies of required textbooks and course materials available to assist those students who are unable to purchase their own, the following publishers will not allow us to purchase e-textbook versions of their publications:</p>

<ul class="mb-1">
	<li>Pearson</li>
	<li>Cengage</li>
	<li>Houghton</li>
	<li>McGraw Hill</li>
	<li>Nelson (no longer publishing in post-secondary market as of June 2020)</li>
	<li>Oxford University Press Canada (Textbook Division)</li>
	<li>Elsevier imprints (especially in veterinary and health science) such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Elsevier Health Science</li>
		<li>Mosby</li>
		<li>Saunders</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Thieme</li>
</ul>

<p>There are additional challenges with ebooks from other publishers, which are summarized in <a href="https://news.library.ualberta.ca/blog/2020/07/20/library-remotely-starting-points-for-ebooks-and-teaching/">this Library blog post</a>.</p>

<p class="mb-1">The Library offers support for instructors who wish to explore and identify viable textbook alternatives, including:</p>

<ol>
	<li class="mb-1">Using an existing ebook in the relevant subject area from the library’s ebook collection or requesting that the library purchase one. There are many academic ebooks that aren’t considered textbooks and are therefore available for the library to purchase.</li>

	<li class="mb-1">Using, revising, or creating an <a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/open-educational-resources">open educational resource</a> (OER). OERs are freely available educational materials that are openly licensed to allow for re-use and modification by instructors. Library staff can help instructors find and adapt relevant resources, or provide them with the tools to create their own open textbooks.</li>

	<li class="mb-1">Creating an online reading list <a href="/course-materials">through the library</a> or directly within your Learning Management System by:
	<ul>
		<li>Linking to content from the library’s existing collection of electronic resources (ebooks, journal articles, streaming media, and other digital materials) or acquiring new content whenever possible.</li>

		<li>Posting individual book chapters or excerpts and scanned copies of the content, subject to copyright limitations as described in the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/faculty-and-staff/copyright/student-staff-guide/ualberta-policies-procedures/fair-dealing-guidelines.html">U of A Fair Dealing Guidelines</a>. Copyright permission can be sought where feasible in cases where the excerpt falls outside of fair dealing guidelines. The <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/faculty-and-staff/copyright/student-staff-guide/for-instructors/review-and-permissions.html">Copyright Office</a> can mediate requests.</li>
	</ul></li>

	<li>Creating a digital course pack via the <a href="https://bookstore.ualberta.ca/t-course-material-resources.aspx">Bookstore</a>. Included readings will first need to undergo a <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/faculty-and-staff/copyright/student-staff-guide/for-instructors/review-and-permissions.html">copyright review and clearance process</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Efforts will be made to secure online materials that are free from digital rights management (DRM) restrictions in order to ensure unlimited student access. DRM includes limits on the number of users that can access a resource at any one time, as well as limits on copying, printing, and downloading.</p>

<p>Instructors are welcome to contact the Library at any time for support with sourcing their course materials.</p>

<p>*This data is based on course textbooks submitted by professors to the Bookstore for the Winter 2024 term.</p>
