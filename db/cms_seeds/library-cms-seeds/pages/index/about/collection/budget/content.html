As outlined in the university’s 2025 budget messaging, the operating grant remains unchanged for the fourth consecutive year—an effective reduction of 13.5% when accounting for inflation. To support a balanced institutional budget for 2025–26, units across campus are implementing cost-containment measures. For the Library, this includes a $500,000 structural reduction to the collections base budget. To align with the university’s budget direction, the Library continues to adjust its collections strategy with a focus on sustaining access to the resources most used and most valued by students, faculty, and researchers.</p><p>The Library is reviewing subscriptions with recurring annual costs and will reduce book purchasing levels in 2025–26. These adjustments help ensure that collections funds remain concentrated on high-impact materials across all disciplines. Where appropriate, subject-specific changes will be communicated directly to affected Faculties and Departments.</p><h2><strong>Key Change: Cancellation of the Springer Electronic Journal Package (January 2026)</strong></h2><p>Beginning January 2026, the Library will discontinue the Springer electronic journal package. This package includes more than 2,000 journals, many of which show limited use at the University of Alberta.</p><p>To support continuity of teaching and research:</p><ul><li>The Library has been unable to negotiate <strong>individual subscriptions</strong> to these journals.</li><li><strong>Nature journals are not affected</strong> and will continue to be available.</li><li>All <strong>previously purchased electronic content remains accessible</strong>.</li><li>Approximately <strong>50% of new Springer Nature articles are published Open Access</strong> and will continue to be available immediately.</li><li><strong>Interlibrary Loan</strong> services remain available for any articles not covered by current subscriptions.</li></ul><p>More information about this change  is available on the <a href="https://news.library.ualberta.ca/blog/2025/12/03/library-subscription-changes-springer-journals/" target="_blank">Library News</a> page.</p><p>The library publishes detailed collection expenditure reports each year within the <a href="https://borealisdata.ca/dataverse/UAL" target="_blank">UAL Data Collection in Borealis</a>.
