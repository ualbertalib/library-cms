      All current students, staff, and faculty of the University of Alberta community are welcome to suggest additions to the Library's collection. Materials that support the research and teaching programs of the University of Alberta will be given first priority.

      Steps to recommend a purchase:
    </p>
    <ol>


      
      <li class="mb-2">Search <a href="/">our catalogue</a> to ensure we do not already have the item you are requesting.</li>
      <li class="mb-2">Complete the <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/recommend_purchase/index.cfm">Recommend a Purchase</a> Form (you may be prompted to enter your CCID.)</li>
      <li class="mb-2">The Library's Collection Strategies Unit will consider your request(s).</li>
      <li class="mb-2">You will be notified when the item arrives (if you request notification) or if we are unable to acquire the item.</li>
    </ol>
   <p>
     <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/recommend_purchase/index.cfm" class="btn btn-green btn-square">Submit your Recommendation</a>
    </p>
     <p>As stated in our <a href="/about/collection/collection-policy">Collection Policy</a>, the Library will acquire material in electronic format where available.</p>
<p>
  Please be advised that delivery of print books (ordered if no ebook is available) often takes 4-6 weeks or longer, depending on availability and vendor location.
