<h3>Teaching &amp; Learning</h3>
<p>Through excellent instruction and support, we respond and adapt to the changing needs of learners. Our information resources, along with our teaching and reference services, provide the scaffolding that learners need to build their academic and professional careers. We believe learners should have access to high-quality information when they need it and where they need it, and we strive to continually expand and improve this access. </p>

<h3>Decolonization &amp; Indigenization</h3>
   
    <p>We actively support the decolonial Indigenization<sup>1</sup> of the University library. Through collaboration across our campuses and in the community we work to dismantle barriers to our collections, spaces, and services. We respect the land on which our library spaces sit and on which we work—Treaty Six and Métis territory. We acknowledge past exclusions and misrepresentations of Indigenous peoples and knowledge systems, as well as the inherent and harmful gaps and oversights in library practices. We make ongoing efforts to move beyond these practices and toward those that further reconciliation, expand accessibility to our resources, and increase equity to our collections and to learning for all.</p>

<h3>Inclusion</h3>
<p>We aim to create a welcoming, inspiring, accessible library where people know they belong and are able to fully and confidently learn, research, collaborate, and work. As a strategic priority we build spaces, collections, and services that value and support our diverse community.</p>

<h3>Research</h3>
<p>We bring curiosity, passion, and expertise to research challenges. We seek to find opportunities to support and participate in all parts of the research lifecycle, from discovery to publication. We work to enable discovery, provide expertise, and access to information and technology. We support research data management and open access publishing.  We work with the community to help understand research impact.</p>
<p>We help lead and build partnerships that enable research to happen locally, nationally, and internationally,  and for knowledge to be optimally shared. </p>
<p>We build on a tradition of service and stewardship, as well as seek new ways to support research in a continually changing environment.</p>
