   As the needs of students continue to change, libraries also evolve to support learning and student life. Let’s discover the potential when we invest in libraries for the public good.</p>

 <p>We have a big vision for the UAlberta Libraries in the future from creating modern spaces for students and faculty to research in comfort, to supporting research with open education resources and digital literacies, to preserving the record for the people of Alberta in an accessible and open way.</p>

 <p>Our libraries act as a campus hub where students, faculty, and the Edmonton community can gather. We ask you to join us with your support and together let’s <strong><em>Discover the Potential!</em></strong>
