    <p class="ua-text">As our society evolves, the library is also changing to keep pace. We are adapting our buildings and the services we offer in them to help students and researchers learn to thrive in an increasingly digital and fluid environment. We seek to help our faculty and graduate students meet the demands of an increasingly open research environment.</p>
    <p class="ua-text">While moving into these new realms, we remain cognizant of our traditional library role as a repository of the record of human activity. In meeting this fundamental obligation for Alberta, we strive to develop and apply cutting-edge technologies and processes to help us meet existing challenges and prepare to meet new ones.</p>
