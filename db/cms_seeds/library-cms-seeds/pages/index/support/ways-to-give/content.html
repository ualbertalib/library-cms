  Ways To Give
</h1>
<h3>Immediate Impact  </h3>
<p>One of the easiest ways to make your gift is with cash, credit card or cheque. Donations can be made by mail, by phone or online.</p>
<p>Your gift can address immediate needs: improving the student experience through our mental initiatives or modernizing our spaces.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tax credit of up to 54%</li>
	<li>Immediate impact - Gift spent same year</li>
</ul>
<h3>Monthly or Annual Giving </h3>
<p>By giving monthly or yearly to the area of your choice, you enhance the student experience and ensure researchers can continue their important work. You keep the momentum of learning going. Any amount makes a difference.</p>
<p>Join a growing number of U of A supporters who make a monthly gift.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Immediate impact â€” Gift spent same year</li>
  </ul>
<h3>Memorial &amp; Tribute Giving</h3>
<p>When a friend or family member passes on, we want memories of them to stay alive. Ensure a fitting and lasting legacy by making a memorial gift in their honour. Your gift can support our long term vision in creating modern spaces, supporting research, and preserving the record.</p>
<p>When a memorial or tribute gift is made, the university sends a card in your name, or anonymously, to the family or honouree. Your name and address are shared, but the amount of your donation is not revealed.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Publicly listed securities include financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Donating them directly to the University of Alberta makes a difference and may entitle you to some significant tax benefits. When you transfer securities to U of A, you receive a tax receipt for their fair market value. Any capital gain will not be taxed, whereas 50% of the gain is taxable if you sell them and donate the proceeds. The tax credit can offset taxes owing on up to 75% of your taxable income in the year of the gift. Any unused portion of the receipt can be carried over for up to five more years. If you donate securities through your will, your estate will get the same tax benefit and a receipt that can reduce up to 100% of your net income in the year of your death. Any remaining part of the receipt can be used to claim a tax refund from the previous year.</p>
<h3>Endowments</h3>
<p>Endowments create a lasting legacy. They provide a steady, predictable and perpetual source of income that ensures the library can enhance collections, provide student professional development, and support student mental health on campus.</p>
<p>The minimum contribution is $50,000. Create a new endowment over a period of up to five years by donating $10,000 a year, for example. Or make a gift of any amount to an existing endowment.</p>
<h3>Bequests</h3>
<p>When you name the University of Alberta Library in your will, you commit to world-changing research and the education of future generations. Your gift can include cash, securities, retirement funds, real estate or other property.</p>
<p>Percentage bequests: Designate all or part of your estate to the University of Alberta Library. The advantage is that there is no need to update that part of your will, even as your estate adjusts in size.</p>
<p>Specific bequests: Designate a fixed dollar amount or a specific property to UAlberta Libraries. The advantage is that the size of the gift remains fixed and is the first to be distributed.</p>
<h3>Structuring your Gift</h3>
<p>Major gifts towards a project or endowment can pledged over a 5 to 10 year period.</p>
