<p>
  The University of Alberta Library (UAL) values its role as a steward of both the print and the digital scholarly record. Stewardship of the scholarly record represents a goal that is larger than any single institution, requiring many willing and active participants to achieve and ensure the best possible outcome. This document outlines our commitment towards undertaking digital preservation activities to the best of our ability and with the explicit goal of ensuring long-term access. 
</p>
<p>
  UAL’s Digital Preservation Framework is informed by the Open Archival Information System (OAIS)<sup><a href="http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/650x0m2.pdf">1</a></sup> reference model and references the attributes outlined in the Trusted Digital Repositories: Attributes and Responsibilities<sup><a href="https://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/activities/trustedrep/repositories.pdf">2</a></sup>, which focuses on the following areas:

  Administrative Responsibility
</h2>
<p>
  UAL is committed to undertaking the steps necessary to preserve materials of enduring value for future research, scholarship, and use. UAL monitors and ensures the integrity, authenticity and usability of digital objects entrusted to its care, including taking necessary actions to mitigate the effects of technological obsolescence and media decay. UAL preserves digital objects in line with the following principles:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Institutional Responsibility</i>:  UAL is committed to supporting the mission of the University of Alberta which includes teaching, learning and research. It provides both services and infrastructure to preserve research and scholarship created at the University, as well as in support of University interests.</li>
  <li><i>Fiscal Stewardship</i>: Stewardship of resources acquired or created by or donated to UAL.</li>
  <li><i>Scholarly Commitment</i>: UAL identifies, acquires, digitizes, and preserves born digital and digitized content in support of scholarship at all levels.</li>
  <li><i>Consortial and Partnership Obligations</i>: UAL undertakes consortial and partnership agreements to share and in some cases, assume responsibility for preserving designated digital content.</li>
  <li><i>Contractual and Legal Obligations</i>: UAL abides by all contractual and legal obligations it has to content publishers and other partners. </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To fulfill the above, UAL engages in the operation of a comprehensive digital preservation program which is: transparent, reliable, scalable, and sustainable.

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>UAL’s digital preservation program includes all digital materials identified to hold value to UAL and its community that fall within its overall collection policy including the Archives Policy of the University of Alberta Archives (UAA). Preservation decisions are based on an assessment of the fitness and long-term access requirements of individual digital objects or collections. The scope of UAL’s digital preservation program includes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Locally produced born-digital resources</li>
      <li>Digital surrogates produced by UAL</li>
      <li>Digital resources acquired by UAL through purchase, donation or other agreement</li>
      <li>Digital resources licensed by UAL with perpetual access and archival rights</li>
      <li>Digital resources preserved in partnership with other parties</li>
      <li>Digitized and born-digital archival records as specified in the UAA Archives Policy.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  </div>
    <hr>
<div class="ual-priorities row">
  <div class="col-lg-11">
<h3>Operational Priniciples</h3>
   <ul>
     <li><i>Strategic Action</i>: Policies and procedures help to define strategic actions that guide an organization towards accomplishing its objectives. UAL acts based on policies and procedures which are clearly understood, well documented, standards-based, and communicable.</li>
     <li><i>Trustworthy Infrastructure</i>: Developing and maintaining necessary hardware, software, and protocols to ensure long-term access is a key component for any digital preservation program. UAL uses technology architectures which ensure the authenticity, integrity and usability of the preserved content.</li>
     <li><i>Compliance</i>: Meeting the requirements of all contracts, licenses, and agreements with respect to rights, responsibilities, and expectations for long-term preservation of designated digital content.</li>
     <li><i>Building Capacity</i>: Building shareable expertise in digital preservation practices, ensuring those responsible for the preservation planning and operations are well-trained and knowledgeable in their practice.</li>
     <li><i>Team-Based Effort</i>: Maintaining a feedback loop on the digital preservation program plan with involved staff at UAL to ensure that disciplinary-specific challenges to preservation in the local environment are addressed.</li>
     <li><i>Collaboration</i>: Identifying and partnering with other institutions and collegial parties to accomplish objectives that cannot be met with UAL’s efforts alone.</li>
     <li><i>Aligning with Communities of Practice</i>: Participating in the development and adoption of digital preservation community standards, practice and solutions.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Roles + Responsibilities</h3>
<p>UAL dedicates positions to the management of the digital preservation function and the lifecycle of digital asset management. These positions are responsible for fulfilling the stewardship, curatorial and technological roles in the following areas: administration, overall coordination, policy development, collection development, organization and description,  infrastructure development, and services.</p>

<h3>Selection + Acquisition</h3>
<p>UAL acquires, creates and preserves digital content of enduring value for future research, scholarship and use, with respect to their intellectual property, privacy, and associated rights.</p>

  </div></div>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<ul>
  <li><i>Technology</i>:  Obsolescence arising from rapid changes in technology creates challenges in preserving digital content in the long term. Like any other organization engaged in digital preservation, UAL strives to be responsive to continually changing technology.</li>
  <li><i>Scope</i>: The ever-increasing volume, variety and exponential growth of digital content adds complexity to the preservation problem. UAL requires policies and procedures in place for systematic selection of content with enduring value.</li>
  <li><i>Cost</i>: High startup investments, unknown maintenance costs, and a lack of mature business models to operate digital preservation programs create challenges for organizations.  With limited budgetary resources, UAL has to be very strategic about funding its digital preservation program.</li>
  <li><i>Expertise</i>: Digital preservation requires a range of specialized professional skills bridging policy, content, metadata, technology, management, security, and related activities. UAL needs to maintain the right complement of staff with the appropriate skills in the face of economic uncertainties and has to provide appropriate training to ensure continuity of services.</li>
  <li><i>Prominence</i>: The magnitude and significance of technical, curatorial and managerial activities required in providing long-term access to digital materials are largely unknown or unrecognized by the wider community receiving such services. UAL needs to raise awareness of the importance of digital preservation for its internal staff and for the broader community it serves.</li>

  Technological + Procedural Suitability
</h2>
<p>
  UAL uses appropriate preservation strategies to deal with challenges related to technological obsolescence. The library adopts preservation strategies which are based on accepted best practices in the digital preservation community. UAL uses a tiered preservation approach, bit-level and full preservation, to address varying preservation requirements. Depending on the level of preservation, a digital object is subject to a series of ongoing preservation actions before and after going into the preservation storage. UAL ensures that digital objects are stored in a reliable archival storage for long-term preservation. The library actively seeks and continuously updates its strategies and infrastructure to ensure long-term preservation.
