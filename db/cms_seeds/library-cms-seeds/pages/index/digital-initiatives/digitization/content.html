<h1> Digitization at the University of Alberta </h1>
<p>We work with several vendors to transform our print and audio visual materials into digital form. Our vendors use specialized equipment that are appropriate for the format and condition of the original works. The digitization process consists of several stages, that include such activities as selecting material; cost analysis; copyright considerations; adding metadata so that the material will be discoverable; and other preparatory work before a collection is ready for any of our multiple scanning streams. Once scanned, all items undergo quality assurance and post-processing work before the digitized files are stored in our preservation system. We are grateful that many partners lend us their own material so that we can enhance the content of our collections.<br>
