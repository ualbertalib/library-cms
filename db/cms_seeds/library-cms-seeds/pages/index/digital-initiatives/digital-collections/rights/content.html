The materials are made available for public viewing at no cost.
</p><p>The University of Alberta does not hold the copyright for most items in the digital collection. Therefore, we cannot respond to or grant permissions related to the reproduction or reuse of these materials. It is the user's responsibility to perform a copyright assessment on the material(s) that you wish to use.
</p><h2>Reproduction or Reuse</h2><p>If you want to reproduce or reuse any material:
</p><ol>
	<li>Firstly, determine if the item is already in the Public Domain, which means the copyright term (and protections) for this material, has expired. Public Domain items are free to reuse without restriction.
	<br>We've identified some items within our collection with the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/">Public Domain Mark 1.0</a>. However, many of our materials have not yet been assessed.
	<br>To determine whether an item is in the Public Domain, please refer to the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/faculty-and-staff/copyright/intro-to-copyright-law/licensed-royalty-free-content/pd-flowchart---types.html">Canadian Public Domain Flowchart</a>.</li>
	<li> If not, does your intended use fit within Fair Dealing or another exception to infringement found in the Copyright Act? Fair Dealing is a statutory right that allows for the reproduction and use of copyright-protected materials for certain purposes without requiring permission, provided that the use/dealing is "fair." For more information about Fair Dealing and other exceptions to copyright infringement, see the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/copyright/intro-to-copyright-law/fair-dealing">Copyright Office's guide on Fair Dealing</a>  and <a href=" https://www.ualberta.ca/faculty-and-staff/copyright/intro-to-copyright-law/other-exceptions.html">Other Exceptions</a>.</li>
	<li>If none of the above applies, consider a Permission Request: Identify and contact the copyright owner(s) directly, to request permission to use the item. We have made available all the information that we know about the materials, and cannot assist further with this type of copyright investigation.</li>
