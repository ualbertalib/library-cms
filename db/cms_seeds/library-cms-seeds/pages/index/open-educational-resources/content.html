  <h2>What are Open Educational Resources?</h2>
<p>Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching and learning materials that are freely and openly available. They can be text documents, audio, video, multimedia, tests, software, learning objects or any other tool used for learning and teaching. The key is that they can be widely distributed and adapted with clear reuse terms, often under a Creative Commons license. At the University of Alberta, we anchor our definition of open to David Wiley's 5 Rs: Retain, Reuse, Revise, Remix, and Redistribute.<sup>1</sup></p>

<h2>Benefits of OER</h2>
<ul>
<li>OER are affordable for students, making education more accessible.</li>
<li>OER allow you to customize and adapt to your context, providing a richer teaching and learning opportunity.</li> 
<li>Students can benefit from multiple learning styles because OER can incorporate various content formats (text, audio, video or multimedia) and interactive elements.</li>  
<li>Remote and continued access since most OER are digital, do not require an access code and do not expire.</li>
<li>Contribute to students’ success and completion by easing their financial burden without having a negative impact on their learning.</li>
</ul>        

</div>
<h2>How to integrate OER into teaching</h2>
<ol>
  

  <li><strong>Find</strong> an existing OER: Look at our <a href="/open-educational-resources/finding-oer">Finding OER</a> guide to learn more about where to look for OER that already exist and how the library can support you in your search.</li>
  <li><strong>Adopt</strong> an existing OER: Either use an OER as is or adapt it for your course by adding or omitting information, changing the examples, providing clarification for your students, translating the content and so on. You can also <a href="/open-educational-resources/creating-oer">create your own OER</a> from scratch with support from our library publishing department. Remember that if you use an OER in your course you can register it as having <a href="/open-educational-resources/ztc">Zero Textbook Cost</a> for students.</li>
  <li><strong>Apply</strong> an open licence to a resource that you have created and/or hold the rights for: Clearly state the conditions for reusing the OER that you have adapted or created by choosing a Creative Commons licence.</li>
  <li><strong>Share and distribute</strong> your OER: Share your OER in distribution networks so others can use it.</li>
  <li><strong>Reuse</strong> your OER: Use your OER in your classes year-after-year without needing to ask for permission.</li>
