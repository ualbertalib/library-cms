 <p> The Sir Samuel Steele Collection is a family archive composed of the papers of Sam Steele, his wife Marie, their children Gertrude, Flora, and Harwood, and family friend Roger Pocock. Housed in <a href="https://bpsc.library.ualberta.ca/">Bruce Peel Special Collections</a>, this extensive collection covers a period from 1870-1978 and treats a wide range of topics including Canadian police history, the Klondike Gold Rush, the Boer War of 1899–1902, Canada’s role in WWI, the Legion of Frontiersmen, as well as family and social history. This site offers researchers several tools with which to explore the collection including a <a href="https://discoverarchives.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/sir-samuel-steele-collection">digital finding aid</a> for print materials and the chance to view a portion of the collection digitally.
