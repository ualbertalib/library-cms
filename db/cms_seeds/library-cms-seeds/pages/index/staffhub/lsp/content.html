  As a member of the Association of Research Libraries and other international organizations, the University of Alberta Library (UAL) has many outstanding collections of print, archival and electronic resources, and a recognized expertise in large-scale digital initiatives. It is also a leading partner in local library networks including NEOS, a provincial consortium consisting of 18 government, hospital, college and university libraries. 
</p>
<p>
 The University of Alberta Library is currently facing significant challenges due to the outdated integrated library system (ILS) that has been in use for the past 20+ years. As a system that was primarily designed to handle print materials, the legacy system is unable to effectively and efficiently handle the integration of all workflows for both print and digital collections, and support new practices and standards to manage resources, resulting in limitations, inefficiencies and poor experiences for library staff and users. Additionally, the current system is based on 25+-year-old technology architecture, making it increasingly expensive and unstable to maintain and support. 
</p>
<p>
 As part of our 2023-2024 strategic goals, UAL has embarked on a project to select and migrate to a new Library Service Platform (LSP) with the latest library system technologies, scalable system architecture, and infrastructure in the next 2 years. This migration will enable the Library to move to a more modern platform that will result in significant savings in staff resources to support and maintain, increase workflow efficiencies within the library, and improve user experiences for the end-users with more unified and consistent experiences. This project aligns with UALâ€™s priorities to enhance the usability, accessibility, and discoverability of its collections by having an enhanced technology ecosystem.

  <h3 id="project-objectives">Project Objectives
  </h3>
<p> <ul>
  <li>To migrate the existing legacy ILS to an LSP with the latest library system technologies, scalable system architecture and infrastructure that can support the strategic goals and long-term needs of the UAL;</li>
  <li>To enhance usability, accessibility, and discoverability of the library collections by having an enhanced discovery ecosystem through seamless system integration between the front-end discovery function with the back-end LSP modules and databases;</li>
  <li>To lay the system foundation for future service growth and change, with more agility, flexibility and sustainability;</li>
  <li>To streamline the existing workflows and processes with reference to the best practices in the library industries;</li>
  <li>To enhance the system availability, stability, security while lowering the system maintenance and support costs by migrating to a cloud-based LSP;</li>
  <li>To reduce the number of systems, applications and integrations by having an enterprise-level LSP that can cover many core library functions of the UAL. </li>
