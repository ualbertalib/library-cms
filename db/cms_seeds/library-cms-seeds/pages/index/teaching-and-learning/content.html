  <h3>
    Digital Literacy
  </h3>
  <p>
    “The ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and
communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills” (Digital Literacy
    Taskforce, 2011). It has also been expanded to include concepts such as misinformation, privacy and the ethical use of online sources and will likely “continue to evolve to become the metaliteracy term which involves both the current capabilities, as well as AI literacy, algorithmic literacy, data literacy, and technological literacy” (Palmer, 2023). </p>

	<h3>
  Critical Information Literacy
   </h3>
<p>
  Critical information literacy (CIL) is a theory and practice that considers the sociopolitical dimensions of information and production of knowledge,and critiques the ways in which systems of power shape the creation,distribution,and reception of information...critical information literacy can be seen as an approach to information literacy informed by critical theory, and often times critical pedagogy (Drabinsky &amp; Tewell, 2019).
