  <p>
    In 2016/2017 library staff taught over 700 classes to approximately 21,000 participants in courses at all levels.</p>
  <p>The library's teaching program consists of three elements: program/course integrated instruction; general workshops; and a suite of online instructional resources designed to help our community of users find, access, use, evaluate, and cite resources in our print and electronic collections. We also teach our professional community, as is outlined in our "<a href="https://www2.library.ualberta.ca/2015assets/teaching-library.pdf">Teaching Library</a>" concept paper.
  </p>
      <p>Instructors are invited to contact their subject librarian to discuss library instruction options for their courses. Subject librarians welcome opportunities to work with instructors on projects such as:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>individualized or classroom instruction in information retrieval and research skills</li>
  <li>designing effective library assignments</li>
  <li>identifying and providing instruction on how to access, use, and evaluate relevant print and electronic collections [e.g. <a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/newspapers">newspapers</a>, <a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/case-studies">case studies</a>]</li>
 <li>identifying relevant open educational resources to support course content</li>
 <li>integrating print and digital resources into blended or online learning environments, including:
   <ul>

 <li><a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/readinglist/index.cfm">persistent links to online library resources on your reading list</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/about-us/projects/eclass-integration">library resources block in eClass</a></li>
 <li>course-specific library guides [e.g.<a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/edu100-300/home">EDU 100/300</a>]</li>
 <li><a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/tutorials/">online library tutorials</a></li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
