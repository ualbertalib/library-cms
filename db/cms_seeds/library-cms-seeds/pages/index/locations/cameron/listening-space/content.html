<p>The Cameron Library Listening Space can be found on the first floor of the library (Cameron 1-40). This space is part of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/ualberta.ca/msl">Sound Mental Health</a> research project and will provide students with a therapeutic space using natural and hybrid soundscapes that adapt to student needs via AI driven technology. This unique environment on campus is intended to help facilitate a state of mindful calm and wellbeing for students as they relax, study, or socialize. </p>
<p>Students will be prompted to provide feedback in real time within the space, as well as when they are leaving the space.</p>
  <p>The Library endeavors to create positive study spaces for students and we hope that this space will promote positive mental and wellbeing for University of Alberta students.</p></div>
