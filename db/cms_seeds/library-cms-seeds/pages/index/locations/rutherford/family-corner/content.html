<p>The University of Alberta Library has partnered with <a href="https://alberta.campuslabs.ca/engage/organization/spoc">Student Parents on Campus</a> (SPOC), the <a href="https://su.ualberta.ca/">Students’ Union</a>, and the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/dean-of-students/index.html">Dean of Students</a> to create the Family Corner in
Rutherford Library. The Family Corner is an accessible child-friendly space on the <strong>third
floor of Rutherford Library (Room 3-114)</strong>.</p>
<p>We have toys and books to entertain your littles, as well as a small kitchen area with a
sink, kettle, bottle warmers and other equipment. The study stations have play pens
close by, and are fully equipped with computers and study equipment. There is a
conference table with chairs, as well as a comfortable seating and a stroller parking
area. We also provide a clean, safe and private lactation/breastfeeding space. There are changing tables available in both washrooms.</p>
