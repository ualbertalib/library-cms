<p>
  
  The Indigenous Learning Space at the Geoffrey &amp; Robyn Sperber Health Sciences Library will be a meeting place in which the community can learn through Indigenous pedagogies and ways of knowing across different First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit cultures.</p> 
  <p>We welcome anyone to schedule this room for meeting and learning together. Learning can take many forms, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visits with Elders</li>
<li>Guest academics</li>
<li>Beading and other art-making</li>
<li>Sharing circles</li>
<li>Traditional teachings</li>
<li>Meetings of Indigenous student groups</li>
<li>Meetings of Indigenous researchers and campus staff</li>
  <li>Writer and artist talks</li></ul>

   
 <p>The Library will host, from time to time, guests who will share knowledge and lead workshops, to which all campus members are welcome. 
  <p>The Indigenous Learning Space is also for smudging. It can hold up to 19 people when the door is closed, and 50 using the surrounding area. </p>
  <p>The Learning Space will receive its name as we continue to work with Kohkom Hazel McKennitt, Elder Martha Campiou, and Indigenous students.  </p>
