<h1>Visitors and Interlibrary Loan </h1>
<p>Visitors affiliated with a <a href="https://curba.ca/">CURBA</a> (Canadian University Reciprocal Borrowing Agreement) institution may use the University of Albertaâ€™s interlibrary loan service while carrying out research or studies at the U of A. Please visit a library service desk to set up your library account.
</p>
<p>Visitors/external borrowers without an affiliation to the U of A or CURBA institution should request interlibrary loan service from their local public library.
