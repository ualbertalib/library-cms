<h3><i>Important Information</i></h3><p>We are phasing out our use of Relais ILL by December 24, 2025. After that date, you will no longer be able to submit requests through the Relais Portal. For Canadian libraries, our preferred method of receiving requests is through Alma Resource Sharing. For non-Canadian libraries and Canadian libraries that don't have Alma Resource Sharing, we will continue to provide interlibrary loan services through WorldShare ILL and Docline.<span></span></p><h3>Borrowing from the University of Alberta Library</h3><p>Our Canadian Library Symbol: <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://sigles-symbols.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/Search/Details?Id=1136">AEU</a> </strong>(click for detailed information)</p><p>We accept the following methods to send requests to us:</p><ol><li>Alma (Canadian libraries only): 01UOA_INST</li><li>OCLC: UAB</li><li>Docline: ABCUJW</li></ol><p>We do not accept requests via e-mail or over the phone.</p><h3>Place Webform Requests (ending December 2025)</h3><p class="red"><a href="https://aeu.relais-host.com/user/login.html?group=library" class="btn ual-btn">Place Requests</a>
