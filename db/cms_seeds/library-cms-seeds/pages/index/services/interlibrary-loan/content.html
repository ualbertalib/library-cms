<h1>Interlibrary Loan/Document Delivery</h1><div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-info me-2"></i>Due to the Canada Post rotating strike, there will be unknown delays in filling Interlibrary Loan requests for books and other physical items.
</div><p>The Interlibrary Loan/Document Delivery department will request books, articles, etc. from other libraries on behalf of UofA students, staff, and alumni, free of charge. We pay any associated fees* (e.g. shipping, copying charges, borrowing charges).
</p><h2>Request an Interlibrary Loan</h2><p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Use the <a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/">Library Search</a> or search any database. Items not held in our collections will provide a link to an Interlibrary Loan form that is automatically filled out.
</p><p><strong>Option 2</strong>: If you're unable to locate a citation in the Library Search, request the item using the form below by logging in and selecting your citation type (book or article). For article requests, you can enter a DOI or PMID and complete the form using the autofill button. Please complete as many fields as possible.

</h2><p>Use <a href="https://ualberta.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/account?vid=01UOA_INST:UOA&section=overview">My Account</a> to view your request and the status of your request. We recommend that you keep your own record of your requests, as My Account will only display active requests and your request information will be removed once the request has been completed. </p><p>Print materials will generally be made available for pickup in the same manner as hold requests. Sometimes, libraries do not want their materials to leave the library premises and they will have to be viewed in a reading room.
