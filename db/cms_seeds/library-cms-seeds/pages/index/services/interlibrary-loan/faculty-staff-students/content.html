<h1>How ILL Requesting Works</h1><p>Students, staff, faculty, and alumni are able to place Interlibrary Loan (ILL) requests for items that the UA Library does not hold, at no charge. </p><p><strong>How do I place a request?</strong><br>
	Use the requesting option in the Library Search or library databases when you locate a citation without access to the full item. If you find the citation elsewhere, you can use the <a href="https://search.library.ualberta.ca/discovery/blankIll?vid=01UOA_INST:UOA">blank form</a>. As we make use of automated processes, complete and accurate information will make it faster to fulfill your requests. </p><p><strong>What happens after I make a request?</strong><br>
	You’ll get an email with a Request ID (starts with <strong>01UOA</strong>). Use this if you need to ask us about your request.
</p><p><strong>How are requests filled?</strong><br>
	The system checks the details you entered (ISBN/ISSN is key!). If there’s a match, it goes directly to a library that can send the book or upload the article. </p><p><strong>What if there’s no match?</strong><br>
	An ILL staff member will review and fix your request before sending it to more libraries.
</p><p><strong>What if no Canadian library has the book?</strong><br>
	We’ll search internationally. For undergrads, we’ll check with you first. If the item is inexpensive, we may just buy it.
</p><p><strong>How will I get my item?</strong>
</p><ul>
	<li>
	<strong>Books:</strong> pick up at your chosen location.</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Articles:</strong> usually emailed as a link or available in your ILL account.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Where do I view the status of my request?</strong><br>
	You can view your request status in the My Account section of the Library Search (you must log in!).
</p><p><strong>When do I contact ILL staff for information on my request?</strong><br>
	Contact us for an update on your request if you have not heard anything from us after two weeks of submitting your request.
