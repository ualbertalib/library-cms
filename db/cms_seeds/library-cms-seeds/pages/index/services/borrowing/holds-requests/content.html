<h1>
  Placing Holds + Requests
</h1>
<h2>
  Placing Holds
</h2>
<p>A hold is an online request to have an item delivered to the library location of your choice. Place a hold for items that are located at a library location that is inconvenient for you to get to (eg. RCRF) or for items that are currently "checked out" to another person. To place a hold follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If your account is blocked for any reason, you will not see the holds button. If this happens to you, please <a href="/ask-us">Ask Us</a> and we will help you</li>
  <li>Find the item you want using <a href="/">Search the Library</a> (make sure you are signed in)</li>

  <li>Click the Place Hold button</li>
  <li>Select your prefered library pickup location</li>
  <li>Wait for the email notification indicating your items are ready for pickup</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  You cannot place holds on Multimedia Technology Lending (video cameras, cameras, etc.), Course Materials or items marked Read on Site.
