<h1>
  Overdue + Lost Items
</h1>


<p>
  
U of A Libraries <strong>does not charge fines</strong> for overdue items. However you will be charged for lost items. </p>


<p>
  At 31 days overdue, you will receive a lost item notice ($150/item - higher charges may be assessed based on cost). This blocks your library and university account. <strong> Note:</strong> Overdue course materials, equipment and robotics will block your account on the same day it is due.</p> 

<p>Once you return your item or pay your fee, the library block is removed immediately and the University block is removed when the system updates every 6 hours (block lifted at 8 am, 2 pm, 8 pm, and 2 am).
</p>
<p>
  Please fill out our <a href="/services/account-inquiries">Accounts Inquiries form</a> if you have questions about lost items or blocks.</p>
