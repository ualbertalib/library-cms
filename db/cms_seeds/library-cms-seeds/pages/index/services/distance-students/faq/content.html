<h1>Distance Students - FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>1. Who is eligible for home delivery service? How does it work?</strong>
</p>
<p>Any current UofA student and faculty located 50 km or more from Edmonton*, either temporarily (e.g. field placement) or ongoing, is entitled to home delivery service, or if you require this service for a medical accommodation. Patrons must <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/distanceeducation/regform/index.php">Register/Renew </a>for delivery of library materials to a home/work address.
</p>
<p><em>*If you're taking courses, or teaching, at a University of Alberta location outside of Edmonton you will need to reside 50 km from that location.</em>
</p>
<p><strong>2. Are there any limits on where materials can be delivered?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong></strong>The Library will deliver books and articles anywhere in Canada. For international locations, the Library will deliver articles only. If a patron wishes to obtain books internationally, they should contact libraries in their area for access to books in their collections, or Interlibrary Loan Service (there may be a fee for this service).
</p>
<p>If there is a <a href="https://www.neoslibraries.ca/member-libraries/" target="_blank">NEOS Library</a> in the vicinity of a distance patron's off-campus location, the patron can have books listed in the NEOS catalogue delivered to that library, and return them to that or any other NEOS Library for delivery back to UofA. Standard loan periods apply. (Note: if patron want articles delivered, they need to register for <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/services/distance-students">Distance Services</a>)<br>
</p>
<p><strong>3. Can distance patrons use the UofA Library in person?</strong><br>
</p>
<p>Yes. If a distance patron signs out materials in person at the UofA, the patron is responsible for getting them back to the library. Return in person or use a reliable courier service at personal expense.
</p>
<p>Distance patrons can also use other libraries near them that are open to the public, e.g. public, college, and university libraries. These libraries may have borrowing agreements with the UofA Library, e.g. <a href="http://www.thealbertalibrary.ab.ca/" target="_blank">TAL</a> and <a href="http://www.curba.ca/" target="_blank">COPPUL</a> libraries, which means the patron can borrow materials from those libraries as well as use them on-site.<br><strong></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>4. What is a <a href="http://www.curba.ca/" target="_blank">COPPUL</a> card and how do I get one?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong></strong>A COPPUL card allows you to borrow materials from any library in Canada that is a member of CURBA, the Canadian University Reciprocal Borrowing Agreement. To obtain a COPPUL card you must have a current <a href="http://www.onecard.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">ONEcard</a> or <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/onecard/get-a-onecard/virtual-onecard.html" target="_blank">Virtual ONEcard</a> and be a borrower in good standing with the UofA Library. COPPUL cards are available from Service Desks or the Document Delivery Office at ill@ualberta.ca.<br>
</p>
<p><strong>5. Does the UofA Library provide service for distance patrons affiliated with other institutions?</strong>
</p>
<p><strong></strong>Yes. These students can use the Library in person, and can obtain an <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/services/library-cards-and-borrowing/visitors">External Borrower's Card</a> if they wish to borrow materials. Other services may be provided by special agreement with their home institution. Contact <strong>depository@ualberta.ca</strong> for more information. <br>
