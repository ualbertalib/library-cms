<h2><a name="books"></a>Reciprocal Borrowing Agreements</h2>
<p>You can also borrow books from your local library anywhere in Canada. The University of Alberta has reciprocal borrowing agreements with other institutions. Check if these apply to your local libraries:
</p>
<p><strong>ONEcard</strong> - Your <a href="http://www.onecard.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">ONEcard</a> allows you to obtain books from the UofA Library and <a href="https://www.neoslibraries.ca/member-libraries/" target="_blank">NEOS member libraries</a>. You can request books through our catalogues, but you can also borrow them in person with your ONEcard.
</p>
<p><strong>TAL card</strong> - You can borrow materials from any Alberta library that is a member of <a href="https://www.thealbertalibrary.ca/" target="_blank">The Alberta Library (TAL)</a>. To obtain your TAL card, contact Interlibrary Loan via email at ill@ualberta.ca.
</p>
<p><strong>COPPUL card</strong> - UofA students, faculty, and staff may borrow materials directly from university and college libraries across Canada, using the <a href="http://www.curba.ca/" target="_blank">COPPUL card</a>. To obtain your COPPUL card, contact Interlibrary Loan via email at ill@ualberta.ca.
</p>
<p>You can also obtain a TAL/COPPUL card at a Service Desk at the UofA Library in-person.
