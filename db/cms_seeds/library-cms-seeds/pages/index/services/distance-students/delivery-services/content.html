<h1>Delivery Services</h1>
<h2><a name="articles"></a>Obtaining articles, books & more</h2>
<p>As a registered <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/services/distance-students">Distance Services</a> patron, you can place a request in two ways…
</p>
<p><strong>1.  <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/">Search the Library</a> catalogue</strong><br>
</p>

</p>
<p>When the item is in our collection, make a request directly from our search results using “Retrieve Catalogue Item/Place Hold” and select “University of Alberta Distance Services” from the drop down pickup library.

<h2><a name="books"></a>Reciprocal Borrowing Agreements</h2>
<p>You can also borrow books from your local library anywhere in Canada. The UofA has reciprocal borrowing agreements with other institutions. Check if these apply to your local libraries:
</p>
<p><strong>ONEcard</strong> - Your <a href="http://www.onecard.ualberta.ca/" target="_blank">ONEcard</a> allows you to obtain books from the UofA Library and <a href="https://www.neoslibraries.ca/member-libraries/" target="_blank">NEOS member libraries</a>. You can request books through our catalogues, but you can also borrow them in person with your ONEcard.
</p>
<p><strong>TAL card</strong> - You can borrow materials from any Alberta library that is a member of <a href="http://www.thealbertalibrary.ab.ca/" target="_blank">The Alberta Library (TAL)</a>. To obtain your TAL card, contact Interlibrary Loan via email at ill@ualberta.ca.
</p>
<p><strong>COPPUL card</strong> - UofA students, faculty, and staff may borrow materials directly from university and college libraries across Canada, using the <a href="http://www.curba.ca/" target="_blank">COPPUL card</a>. To obtain your COPPUL card, contact Interlibrary Loan via email at ill@ualberta.ca.
</p>
<p>You can also obtain a TAL/COPPUL card at a Service Desk at the UofA Library in-person.
