<h1>L-Pass Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>
<h2>Eligibility + Registration</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Q: </strong><strong>Can anyone register for the L-Pass?</strong> A: The L-Pass is exclusively available to most current University of Alberta students and staff.</li>
	<li><strong>Q: Is there a cost for the L-Pass?</strong> A: No, the L-Pass is provided at no cost to U of A students and staff.</li>
	<li><strong>Q: Is my ONEcard my L-pass?</strong> A: Starting in fall 2025, the L-pass is only being issued as a digital card and is accessed through the official EPL app. If you registered for an L-Pass prior to July 2025 with your ONEcard barcode, you can continue to use that account and your ONEcard. </li>
	<li><strong>Q: I am a Continuing & Professional Education student. Can I register for the L-Pass?</strong> A: In general, students registered only in Continuing & Professional Education courses are not eligible for the L-Pass. Regular EPL memberships are available at any Edmonton Public Library branch.</li>
	<li><strong>Q: Can I register for this L-Pass at the Edmonton Public Library?</strong> A: No. Registration for the L-Pass is only available through the University of Alberta Library's L-Pass registration website.</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I tried to register for the L-Pass but was unsuccessful. What should I do?</strong> A: Please contact the Edmonton Public Library (EPL) directly for assistance with registration and account issues:<a href="https://www.epl.ca/"> https://www.epl.ca/</a></li><strong>Q: Why do I need to give my personal information to the Edmonton Public Library to obtain an L-Pass?</strong> A: EPL requires this information to establish your account in their system. Your personal information will not be used for any other purposes.
</ul>
<h2>L-Pass vs. Other Cards</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Q: I'm a current student but I already have an EPL library card. Can I still get the L-Pass?</strong> A: Yes. Existing EPL card holders must still register for the L-Pass through the U of A Library website. While you are a student, your L-Pass account will be the one used to access all EPL services—not your existing EPL card.</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I am a U of A student and I already have a TAL card (The Alberta Library). Can I still use the L-Pass?</strong> A: Yes. You can continue to use your TAL card at all participating library systems in Alberta. However, the L-Pass provides access to all available EPL services, while the TAL card does not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Expiry, Renewal + Use</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Q: Do I have to register for this service each year?</strong> A: Yes, the L-Pass must be renewed annually. Your account expires each year on September 30th. You can re-register up to 40 days before your expiry or anytime after, provided you are still a current U of A student or staff member.</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I am registered in the winter session and will continue my studies in the fall. Do I have access to EPL services during spring and summer sessions?</strong> A: Yes. L-Pass accounts for all current students are valid through the spring/summer and expire uniformly on September 30th.</li>
	<li><strong>Q: Do I have to pay late charges for overdue materials at EPL?</strong> A: No, EPL is fine free. You will only be charged a replacement fee for any lost or damaged items. (More information on replacement fees can be found <a href="https://www.epl.ca/borrowing-guide/">here</a>). Outstanding fees will not affect your University of Alberta Library account or privileges.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PIN + Account Access</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Q: I am an existing EPL library card holder. Can I re-use my existing PIN with this service?</strong> A: Yes, existing EPL PINs can be re-used. If you do not have a PIN, you will be prompted to create one for access to online services during registration.</li>
	<li><strong>Q: I have forgotten my EPL PIN number. How can I find out what it is?</strong> A: Use EPL’s <a href="https://www.epl.ca/my-account/#reset-pin">Reset your PIN/password</a>, or you can call any EPL branch. Confirmation of your card number and other account details will be required to retrieve the PIN over the phone.</li>
