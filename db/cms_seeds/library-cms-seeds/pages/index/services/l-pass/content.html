<h2>What is the L-Pass?</h2>

	<p>The University of Alberta Library has partnered with the <strong>Edmonton Public Library (EPL)</strong> to provide current U of A students and staff with convenient access to public library services.
	</p>
	<p>An L-Pass grants you access to all EPL services, including:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Online resources (e.g., Libby audiobooks)</li>
		<li>Physical materials (books, magazines, videos/DVDs, and more)</li>
		<li>Inter-library loans</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2>How to Register for Your L-Pass</h2>
	<p>Eligibility: Current University of Alberta students and staff are eligible.
	</p>
	<p>To Register: Simply click <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/epl/librarycard/">the registration link</a> and complete the process to create your new L-Pass EPL account.
	</p>
	<p>Once registered, you can immediately access EPL e-resources and place holds on materials using your L-Pass account and password.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Accessing Services & Using Your Pass</h2>
	<p>Your L-Pass is a digital card only and it is not connected to your U of A ONEcard or U of A Library account.
	</p>
	<p>To check out physical materials at any EPL location, you must use your L-Pass digital EPL card, which is accessed through the official <a href="https://www.epl.ca/epl-app/">EPL app</a>.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>Renewing Your L-Pass</h2>
	<p>The L-Pass must be renewed annually to maintain continuous service. Check <a href="https://epl.bibliocommons.com/account" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://epl.bibliocommons.com/account&source=gmail&ust=1760536582756000&usg=AOvVaw381efPpTkEAE1ncH-bO86a">your EPL account</a> for the expiry date.
	</p>
	<p>To Renew: Simply re-register for the L-Pass again from <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/epl/librarycard/">this link.</a>
	</p><p><b>Important Note for Libby and Hoopla users:</b> If you enter a new password during the renewal process, you will also need to update Libby and Hoopla with this new password to continue accessing those services.<br></p>
	<hr>
	<h3>Important: Note on 2025 Account Changes</h3>
	<p>The registration and renewal process for the L-Pass changed in September 2025. If you tried to create or renew your account between August 20 and September 9, 2025, there may have been an issue with your account setup.
	</p>
	<p>We invite any user who registered during that specific window to <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/epl/librarycard/">register again now</a> to ensure your L-Pass EPL account is active and linked correctly.
