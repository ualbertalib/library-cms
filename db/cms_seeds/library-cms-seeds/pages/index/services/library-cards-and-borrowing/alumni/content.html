<p>
	<strong>Number of items that can be borrowed</strong>: 30
</p>
<h4>
Renewal
</h4>
<p>
	UAlberta/NEOS items can be renewed four times if no other user needs the item. If you still need material after your renewal limit has been reached, you will need to bring the material back to a UAlberta/NEOS Library Service Desk. It will then be discharged, and you may sign out the material again.
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	*When items are overdue, your account will be blocked and you will not be able to renew online. If you need assistance with renewing a book , please call 780-492-4174 / Augustana: 780-679-1156.
</p>
<h4>
Fines
</h4>
<p>
	Fines are charged at the rates outlined in the table above to a maximum of $31.00 per item. When fines reach $50.00 or above, borrowing privileges for the account will be blocked until the fine is paid down to below $50.00.
</p>
<h4>
Suspension of Borrowing Privileges
</h4>
<p>
	Borrowing privileges will be suspended: when items on loan are overdue (starting on the first day they are overdue) or when bills/accruing fines total over $50.00.
</p>
<h4>
Lost Book Charge
</h4>
<p>
	Before paying a lost book charge, it's a good idea to contact the owning library first to determine whether the book may have been returned without being discharged.
</p>
<p>
	There will be a charge of $150.00 for each lost item. If a lost item is found and returned after a lost book charge has been paid, a refund will issued up to one year after payment of the lost book charge. The found material must be returned direclty to a Service Desk before initiating the refund process. $31.00 late fines will still apply.
</p>
<h4>
Other Charges<br>
</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Discretionary fine (for breach of regulations, abuse of privileges, etc): $50.00</li>
	<li>NSF Cheque Charge: $25.00</li>
	<li>Rebinding/repair charges for items returned damaged: Charges will vary</li>
</ul>
