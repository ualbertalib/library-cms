	<strong></strong><strong>Number of items that can be borrowed</strong>: Unlimited
</p>
<h4>
Renewal </h4>
<p>
	UAlberta Items can be renewed four times if no other user needs the item. If you still need material after your renewal limit has been reached, you will need to bring the material back to a UAlberta Library Service Desk. It will then be discharged, and you may sign out the material again.
</p>
<p>
	*When items are overdue, your account will be blocked and you will not be able to renew online. If you need assistance with renewing a book , please call 780-492-4174 / Augustana: 780-679-1156.
</p>
<h4>
Fines
</h4>
<p>
	Fines are charged at the rates outlined in the table above to a maximum of $31.00 per item.
</p>
<h4>
Suspension of Borrowing Privileges
</h4>
<p>
	Borrowing privileges will be suspended when: 1) bills/accruing fines total over $50.00; 2) materials are overdue for more than 31 days (items will then be considered lost and a charge of $150.00 will be added to your account); or 3) when Recalled material is not returned by the revised due date.
</p>
<h4>
Lost Book Charge
</h4>
<p>
	Before paying a lost book charge, it's a good idea to contact the owning library first to determine whether the book may have been returned without being discharged, and for material belonging to non-UAlberta Libraries, to determine policies and procedures regarding payment for lost books. Lost book charges for books owned by non-UAlberta NEOS Libraries must be paid to the owning library.
	<br>
</p>
<p>
	For UAlberta material, there will be a charge of $150.00 for each lost item. If a lost item is found and returned after a lost book charge has been paid, a refund will be issued up to one year after payment of the lost book charge. The found material must be returned direclty to a Service Desk before initiating the refund process. $31.00 late fines will still apply.
</p>
<h4>
Other Charges<br>
</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Discretionary fine (for breach of regulations, abuse of privileges, etc): $50.00</li>
	<li>NSF Cheque Charge: $25.00</li>
	<li>Rebinding/repair charges for items returned damaged: Charges will vary</li>
</ul>
<h4>
