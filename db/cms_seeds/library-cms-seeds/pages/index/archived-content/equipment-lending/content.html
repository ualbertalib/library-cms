<h2>The library is closing the equipment lending program permanently due to budget cuts as of August 10, 2020.</h2><br><p>The equipment lending program has been on hiatus since March, when we all went into quarantine for COVID-19. Some equipment will be transferred to the Dean of Students to contribute to their efforts to help students in need.
</p><p><br></p><h3>FAQs</h3><p><strong>I have some library equipment signed out - what should I do?</strong><br>Library staff is emailing each person who currently has library equipment signed out with further instructions. Please check your inbox.<br><br>
</p><p><strong>Can I purchase the laptop Iâ€™ve borrowed from the library?</strong><br>
	No. The Dean of Students is working with students in need for access to laptops/chromebooks. Contact: doshelp@ualberta.ca<br><br>
</p><p><strong>I use this program a lot - is there an alternative program on campus?</strong><br>
	The Dean of Students has initiated a lending program for students without tech equipment. <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/provost/dean-of-students/laptop-lending-program.html">To apply, please visit their website.</a><br><br>
</p><p><strong>Are there resources available to help guide students as to what technology to buy for remote learning?</strong><br>
	Yes. As students prepare for Fall 2020, we suggest that they consult the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/information-services-and-technology/services/software-hardware-vendors/technology-requirements.html">recommended tech needs</a> outlined by the U of A's Information Services and Technology (IST) department.<br><br>
</p><p><strong>I borrowed laptops sometimes for access to specialized software, not the computer itself. What are my options?</strong><br>IST provides some software to download: <a href="https://ualberta.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_cs=1&cmi_mnuMain=70eccc40-3868-e311-93f8-b8ca3a5db7a1">IST On-the-Hub</a>. For specialized software access, please contact IST.<br><br>
</p><p><strong>Where is all that equipment going?</strong><br>
	Some of the laptops will be transferred to the Dean of Students to contribute to their efforts to help students in need.
