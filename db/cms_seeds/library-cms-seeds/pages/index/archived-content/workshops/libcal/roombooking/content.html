                two hour block maximum, other libraries permit 2.5 hr bookings.
                Minimum group size is two people.

<p>
	Please remove all personal items and garbage when vacating
                rooms.
</p>
<p>
	Rooms are not secure. You are responsible for all personal
                items left in your group room.
</p>
<p>
	As a courtesy, please delete your booking if your plans
                change and you decide that you will be unable to
                attend.
	<strong>Note: A 10 minute grace period will be given for
                all room bookings and occupancy, after which time groups may
                forfeit their booking to other groups who may be waiting for a
                space to open.
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	To ensure equitable access to Cameron Library Group Study
                Rooms during exam periods, rules may be revised. Access to
                Group Study Rooms is to be shared by all students.Students are
                reminded that block booking of rooms is not acceptable.
</p>

	<strong>Please take care of the equipment and facilities so
                that we can continue to offer you these services.
