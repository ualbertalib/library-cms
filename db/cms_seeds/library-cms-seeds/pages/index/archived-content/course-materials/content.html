<h2>Other Resources for Instructors</h2><p>Library staff can help you identify library materials, or alternative sources of course material that is both online, and no-cost or low-cost to students.
</p><p>Alternatives to print textbooks include:
</p><ul>
	<li>Open Educational Resources: we can search for open online textbooks, and provide you with a list of high quality options that are free to use and share.</li>
	<li>Ebooks and other online resources that are already in our collection: including ebooks, reference sources and articles in online databases. Most of these have no limits on the number of users that can access them.</li>
	<li>Purchase materials on demand: if we do not currently own an ebook version, we can investigate purchasing titles for our collection.</li>
</ul><h3><a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/about-us/staff/subject-librarians">Consult a Librarian</a></h3><p>Librarians can advise about assigning online library resources, such as ebooks, articles, and streaming film and music.<br><a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/about-us/staff/subject-librarians">Find the librarian for your subject area here</a>.
