<h3>Masks Strongly Recommended</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend that you continue to wear masks in our library locations - these are high-traffic and high-capacity spaces where you may be in close proximity to others. We also ask that students, faculty, staff and visitors to the U of A Library respect the choices of others in our community regarding masking as we transition into this next phase together.</p>
     <p>Please note that <strong>masks remain mandatory</strong> at the <a href="/locations/scott">John W. Scott Health Sciences Library</a> as this library is located in an <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/masks.aspx">Alberta Health Services operated building.</a></p>

 <!--    <h3>Library Study Rooms </h3>
     <p><a href="/services/book-study-space">Study rooms</a> are available for booking for UA students. The library also has <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/registrar/examinations/classroom-bookings/temporary-workspace-locations.html" target="blank">temporary drop-in and bookable spaces</a> for attending online classes while on campus for Fall 2021.
     <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/registrar/examinations/classroom-bookings/temporary-workspace-locations.html" target="_blank">These campus drop-in spaces</a> are designated during specified days/times as quiet zones intended for online exams.</p><hr/>
       <h3>
         
         Course Materials </h3>   <p>Course Materials (formerly Reserves) are accessible in print with short loan periods either in a Course Materials Room or at a Service Desk in our libraries. We highly recommend creating a <a href="/reading-lists">Reading List</a>  to alert our staff to the items that you need available for your students. It may take some time to purchase and receive items, so please create your list well in advance of the start of classes each term.</p> <p>Library staff can help you identify library materials, or alternative sources of course material, that are both online and no-cost or low-cost to students. If assigning a required textbook for your students, textbook adoption requests should be submitted to the UAlberta Bookstore.</p> -->
