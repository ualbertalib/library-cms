<h2>Displays/Exhibits/Events</h2><p><br>
</p><p>The University of Alberta Library provides spaces and support for displays, and exhibits that support University of Alberta teaching and research. We also, on a selective basis, provide spaces for student groups and other campus partners to host their events. Policies and procedures on this page do not cover the <a href="https://bpsc.library.ualberta.ca/exhibits">exhibitions program at Bruce Peel Special Collections</a> or library sponsored displays and events. Some examples of previous exhibits can be found at <a href="http://ualbertalibrarynews.blogspot.ca/search/label/exhibits">http://ualbertalibrarynews.blogspot.ca/search/label/exhibits</a>. As our space is limited we operate through the following principles:
</p><ul>
	<li>All exhibits, displays and events must be non-commercial and may not advertise commercial products or services. The only exception being bake sales for student groups.</li>
	<li>Many of the libraries work regularly with established partners and have limited flexibility to accommodate other requests.</li>
	<li>Non-University groups may be considered depending on the purpose of the exhibit or based on a strong connection to the U of A.</li>
	<li>The library does not host events during extended hours, provide security/monitoring for events, and is not responsible for loss or damage to materials including material in locked cabinets.</li>
	<li>The library provides space and in some cases equipment (e.g., display boards and cases); groups are responsible for supplies, setup, take down and ongoing monitoring and maintenance.</li>
	<li>Student groups must be recognized by Student Services as a student group and in addition to working through us must book their event through the <a href="https://www.su.ualberta.ca/services/studentgroups/faq/beardenandccr/">Student Services Event Booking system</a>. </li>
	<li>As library activity and display spaces are also study spaces, we will always balance the needs of students who are studying and groups wanting to use the space for activities.</li>

                (e.g. posters/research projects), submissions that fall outside these areas are selectively considered. We have several annual exhibits and tend to be solidly booked about 1 year in advance. Open space does occur so we can often work in
                additional exhibits when we can. Rutherford hosts bake sales in the Galleria.
