<p>The research data management (RDM) landscape in Canada is rapidly evolving - from funder policies, to institutional strategies, data management planning, data deposit and beyond! 
<strong>Join us for the 6th annual Research Data Management Week May 6 - 10, 2019!</strong>
</p><p>This year’s RDM Week will offer both a wide range of applied learning and information sessions, as well as discussions regarding the changing landscape, including the 2018 draft  <a href="http://www.science.gc.ca/eic/site/063.nsf/eng/h_97610.html">Tri-Agency Research Data Management Policy</a>, which demonstrates both the importance of RDM and some of the challenges faced by researchers and institutions regarding the management of research data.
