			<h2>
			The Library's Textbook Initiative</h2>
			<p>To reduce the cost burden for students, the Library lends out copies of many textbooks stocked by the Bookstore. This effort is known as our Textbook Initiative. The Bookstore supplies us with lists of assigned textbooks before the start of each term. Using these lists, we work to purchase as many textbooks as we can. The following parameters guide how many copies of each textbook we will purchase.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We acquire only <strong>required</strong> textbooks (ie., not just recommended).</li>
				<li>If we can purchase an ebook version of a textbook, we do so.</li>
				<li>If no ebook is available, we buy print copies. For courses with up to 125 students, we buy one (1) copy. For courses with more than 125 students, we will buy up to five (5) copies in total.</li>
				<li>Print textbooks are located in the corresponding library's Course Materials collection.</li>
				<li>Print textbooks can generally be borrowed for two hours at a time.</li>
				<li>A Talis Aspire list for the course is created by library staff and the items acquired through the Textbook Initiative are added. If you create your own list, you can ask us to remove the library created list.</li>

			<h2>Other Resources for Instructors</h2>
			<p>Library staff can help you identify library materials, or alternative sources of course material that is both online, and no-cost or low-cost to students.
			</p>
			<p>Alternatives to print textbooks include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open Educational Resources: we can search for open online textbooks, and provide you with a list of high quality options that are free to use and share.</li>
				<li>Ebooks and other online resources that are already in our collection: including ebooks, reference sources and articles in online databases. Most of these have no limits on the number of users that can access them.</li>
				<li>Purchase materials on demand: if we do not currently own an ebook version, we can investigate purchasing titles for our collection.</li>
			</ul><a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/about-us/staff/subject-librarians">Consult with your subject Librarian</a>
			<p>Librarians can advise about assigning online library resources, such as ebooks, articles, and streaming film and music.
