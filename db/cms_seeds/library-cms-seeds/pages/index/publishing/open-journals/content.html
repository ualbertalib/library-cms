	fruitful exchanges between francophonies; 3) to develop a francophone postcolonialism; 4) to explore the many
	cultural and identity configurations produced in the francophone context; 5) to implement a francophonie of resistance
	in reaction to linguistic and cultural totalitarianisms of any kind.
