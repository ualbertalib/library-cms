<h1>Publishing at the Library</h1><p>The University of Alberta Library is an important stakeholder for scholarly publishing in Canada. Our open access publishing program supports open, sustainable, and responsible models of scholarly communication and helps to create a more equitable and robust scholarly communications ecosystem. Currently, we partner with Canadian organizations and individuals to publish fully open access scholarly journals, and with University of Alberta community members to publish open course textbooks.
</p><h2>Journal Publishing
</h2><p>The University of Alberta Library provides significant support to over 60 Canadian open access journals through our no-fee publishing program. We provide web hosting for journals using the <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/" target="_blank">Open Journal Systems (OJS)</a> publishing software and provide several value-added publishing services. All journals partnering with the Library in this program operate under a “Diamond Open Access” model and do not charge fees to authors.
