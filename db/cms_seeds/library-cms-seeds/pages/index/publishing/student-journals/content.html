<h1>Student Journals</h1><p>Publishing student journals at the University of Alberta is a community effort, led by students. Students manage and staff editorial teams, conduct peer review, and contribute research. Student run journals provide a collaborative platform for sharing research and for students to gain training and hands-on experience in various aspects of scholarly publishing. University of Alberta student journals publish research across a range of disciplines, with contributions from undergraduate and graduate students as well as established professionals and scholars.
</p><p>Student journals are supported by the University of Alberta Library with publishing infrastructure, training and instruction, technical support, and guidance on policies and best practices related to scholarly communication. Through the use of Open Journal Systems (OJS), these research articles are available and accessible online, free-of-charge.
</p><p>Working on a student journal provides hands-on experiential learning opportunities. Students participate in the scholarly communication process in these ways:
</p><ul>
	<li>Reading student journals is a low-barrier way to introduce learners to academic reading, writing, and research. Readers are able to easily find exemplary revisions of works in their discipline, which can help them understand learning outcomes, expectations, and standards around scholarly communication.</li>
	<li>Contributing content allows students to share their research, and having work peer reviewed provides the opportunity to improve their own research, writing, and communication skills.</li>
	<li>Participating in peer review and copyediting provides the opportunity to learn how to review and revise work, provide constructive feedback, while also expanding knowledge of literature in their field of study. Ultimately, improving individual research and writing skills.</li>
	<li>Serving on an editorial board provides the opportunity to network and develop numerous skills associated with working collaboratively, managing teams and projects, and conducting communication and outreach.</li>
</ul><h2>Get Involved</h2><p>Interested in getting involved in student publishing, or publishing your research? Many student journals accept original research and submissions of existing class work, so if you worked on an interesting assignment you’d like to share, reach out to a journal in your field of study. There are also many opportunities to volunteer as a peer reviewer, copyeditor, or editorial team member.
</p><h2>Journal List</h2><p>Connect directly with an existing student journal to learn more about publishing and volunteer opportunities, and to see new research in your area of study.
