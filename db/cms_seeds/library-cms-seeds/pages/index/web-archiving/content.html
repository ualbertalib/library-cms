<h1>Web Archiving at the University of Alberta</h1>
<div class="row">
  

<div class="col-md-8">
  

<p>The University of Alberta Library (UAL) provides web archiving services to capture and preserve online content in support of the university’s teaching and research. Content collected is of interest to both current and future researchers, academics, and scholars at the University of Alberta, as well as the general public. We endeavour to acquire quality materials that are appropriate in meeting the needs of the wide range of subject areas taught and researched at the University of Alberta. </p>
<p>UAL is using the web archiving service Archive-It to capture and preserve at-risk web content. In particular, content that is of a local nature, or pertaining to western Canada, has been a focus. </p>
<p>We aim to make publicly available as much content from our web archive collection as possible. Archiving the content without restrictions ensures long term access by faculty, staff, students and researchers at the University of Alberta, as well as researchers and scholars outside the institution. </p>
