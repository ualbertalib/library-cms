		<div class="mt-4">
			<p>All Entry Submissions must be high resolution, as semi finalist and winning entries will be printed for the Images of Research Exhibition.
			</p>
			<h3>
			TO QUALIFY FOR THE COMPETITION
			</h3>
			<p>
				Your image must:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Only</strong> be submitted in either .jpg, .jpeg, .png, or .tiff file formats.</li>
				<li>Be at a <strong>minimum of 200 dpi</strong> for image quality.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Please use our online <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W64TVo2lE_Js9n_aHivnGjqGhLf2U0IfE876HbBEPO0/edit#gid=0">Image + Resolution Tool</a> (12"x18" or 15"x15" image size) to verify your image's dpi. </li>
				</ul>
				<li>If your image does not correspond to the above aspect ratios, the IOR Team will resize the image only for printing.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>For the purposes of judging and online display, your image will remain consistent with your submission.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<h3>
			SUBMISSION BEST PRACTICES
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Do not resample your submission in Photoshop (or similar) to increase the size or dpi.</li>
				<li>Avoid digital zoom when taking photos; instead, rely on optical zoom.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>To learn more, consult <a href="https://thesmartphonephotographer.com/what-is-optical-zoom/">this resource.</a></li>
				</ul>
				<li>When shooting, try to stabilize the camera as much as possible to avoid blurring.</li>
				<li>Choose appropriate lighting conditions that help enhance the colour and clarity of the image.</li>
				<li>Make sure to send in the highest-resolution version of your image.</li>
				<li>When using your phone, use the “JPEG max” or “Original Size” settings to avoid compression.</li>
			</ul>

				<div class="mt-4">
					<p>
						There are two components to the competition's written requirements: the title and short description, and the creation process.
					</p>
					<h3>
					1) TITLE + SHORT DESCRIPTION
					</h3>
					<p>
						All Entry Submissions must have a title and be accompanied by a short description (max.1200 characters), including what the image portrays and how it relates to your research.
					</p>
					<p>The title you choose for your image and your description should effectively communicate their relationship to your image and your research. Consider the following questions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Do the title and description clearly relate to the image?</li>
						<li>Does the image effectively represent your research according to the accompanying description?</li>
						<li>Does the entire package (image, title, description) make sense in the context of your research?</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>
					2) THE CREATION PROCESS + ALT TEXT DESCRIPTION
					</h3>
					<p>Additionally, a critical aspect of your submission should be a detailed discussion about the creation process of the image (max. 1200 characters). This should involve an explanation of the techniques, tools, or methods used in creating the image. It's important to articulate how these aspects of the creation process are connected to your research. This additional information can provide valuable context and depth, helping the judges understand the connection between your image and your research more thoroughly.
					</p>
					<p>
						To enhance the accessibility of the Entry Submission, each must also include an Alt Text (alternative text) description. This description should succinctly convey the essence and details of the image for those who are unable to view it, such as individuals using screen readers. The Alt Text must be clear and concise (max. 125 characters), ensuring it effectively communicates the visual aspects relevant to the research depicted in the image.
					</p>

						<h2 id="criteria"><i class="fa-solid fa-award mr-2"></i> COMPETITION CRITERIA + JUDGING</h2>
