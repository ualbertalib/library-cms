</p>
<p>b. A currently enrolled U of A GPS student. A current U of A GPS student must be in good standing with U of A. A <em>student in good standing</em> at the U of A is set out in the U of A calendar to mean a student who has first class, satisfactory or marginal standing, provided if a student has marginal standing, such student cannot be on probation or the subject of an academic warning.
</p>
<p>You are not eligible for the Competition if you are a resident of Quebec. All decisions regarding eligibility to enter this Competition and the Entry Submissions will be determined by the U of A at its sole discretion. This Competition is void where prohibited by law.

The submissions can include photographs, images, visualizations and drawings. All Entry Submissions should be in .jpg, .png, or .tiff file formats and a minimum 200 dpi when the print size is at 12" x 18 or 15”x15". If the image size does not fit this aspect ratio, the IOR team reserves the right to resize the image for both digital and print display, in consultation with the participant and in adherence to the 200 dpi minimum requirement. If any AI tool was used in the creation or enhancement of the image, the Entry Submission must comply with the University’s <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/media-library/artificial-intelligence/framework-for-responsible-and-ethical-use-of-ai.pdf" >Framework for Ethical AI Use</a>, including transparent disclosure and copyright responsibility. Entry Submissions not meeting these specifications will be disqualified.
