      <h2> About Images of Research </h2>
      <p>Images of Research (IOR) is an opportunity for current University of Alberta (U of A) graduate students from all disciplines to capture, share and present the essence of their research in one image.
</p>
        <p class="mt-3">
<p>The IOR competition, digital exhibition and showcase for semi finalists preserve graduate research in digital form, providing an opportunity for graduate students to communicate their research in a different medium and capture the attention of new audiences.
 
      <p>
      <p>A multidisciplinary jury will select the semi finalists and winners according to the following criteria:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Overall originality/creativity of the submission</li>
	<li>Aesthetic appeal of the image</li>
	<li>Relationship between image and student’s research</li>
	<li>Clarity of title and written description</li>
</ul>
<p>Four prizes will be awarded as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>First Place - $800</li>
	<li>Second Place - $600</li>
	<li>Third Place - $500</li>
