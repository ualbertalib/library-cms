 <p>First established in the 2015-2016 academic year, the University of Alberta's <em>Images of Research Competition + Exhibition</em> (IOR) is an opportunity for current U of A graduate students from all disciplines to capture, share and present the essence of their research in one image.
</p>

    <p>The IOR competition, digital exhibition and showcase for semi-finalists preserve graduate research in digital form, providing an opportunity for graduate students to communicate their research in a different medium and capture the attention of new audiences.</p>
    

  <p>
    A multidisciplinary jury selects semi-finalists and winners, ultimately awarding first, second, and third place. All semi-finalists are entered into the pool for a People's Choice winner to be selected by the community at large. Semifinalists will have their image and description immortalized in the U of A's <a href="https://era.library.ualberta.ca/communities/e14a6354-b557-4a15-8e99-70ad237be121">Education + Research Archive (ERA)</a> <em>Images of Research</em> collection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Images of Research is organized by the U of A <a href="/">Library</a> and the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/graduate-studies/index.html">Faculty of Graduate + Post Doctoral Studies</a> (GPS).
