<p class="ual-breadcrumbs"><a href="/" >University of Alberta Library Home</a> <span>&gt;</span> <a href="/services">Library Services</a> <span>&gt;</span> ORCID</p>
<p><a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCID</a> provides a persistent digital identifier that distinguishes you from every other researchers and supports automated linkages between you and your professional activities ensuring that your work is recognized.
</p>
<p>Unlike other research identifiers, ORCID is universal and works across a variety of different platforms.
</p>
<p>You can get set yourself up with an ORCID in 3 easy steps:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Register</strong>. <a href="https://orcid.org/register" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orcid.org/register&source=gmail&ust=1554994067240000&usg=AFQjCNHFJUDMWvLw5UnV0xqNCv3AzD_0-w">Registration</a> is free and takes about 30 seconds. </li>
	<li><strong>Add some data.</strong> Once you've registered, you can add information about your scholarly record and achievements. This will ensure that you are associated with your work. Much of this data input can be automated. More details are available <a href="https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973133" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973133&source=gmail&ust=1554994067240000&usg=AFQjCNEeTCOcLbdFW7mw4liy6QoIGnO2wg">here</a>. </li>
	<li><strong>Market yourself.</strong> Include your ORICD ID in your email signature, on your webpage, when publications are submitted, applying for grants, and in many other research workflows. That way, you'll receive credit for your hard work and you'll provide one step access to your work and achievements.</li>
</ol>
<p>Too busy to do all of this yourself?
</p>
<p>You can grant a delegate access to your ORCID records, and they can update and manage records on your behalf. Note that delegates must have their own ORCID ID to log in. You can add a trusted individual in your account settings.
</p>
<p>If you require help or have any questions about registering for or maintaining an ORCID ID, please contact <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/about-us/staff/subject-librarians" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.library.ualberta.ca/about-us/staff/subject-librarians&source=gmail&ust=1554994067240000&usg=AFQjCNFI0ZUJfOMquRctLPrDI6TJRZUs8g">your subject librarian</a>.

<p><strong>ORCID API</strong><br>
</p>
<p>University of Alberta is an institutional member of <a href="https://orcid-ca.org/home" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://orcid-ca.org/home&source=gmail&ust=1554994067240000&usg=AFQjCNFvrAZy9Avu5WIm-yUL3J1LDvtcjQ">ORCID-CA</a> . This means that we can use the <a href="https://info.orcid.org/documentation/features/member-api/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://members.orcid.org/api/about-orcid-apis&source=gmail&ust=1554994067240000&usg=AFQjCNGl26qvRYXzp8URKjRkSZPq2KRYSA">member API</a> to populate systems.
</p>
<p>This allows our university community to reuse information available from ORCID. An example of this is available on the University of Alberta Chemistry's <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/chemistry" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ualberta.ca/chemistry&source=gmail&ust=1554994067240000&usg=AFQjCNGDfb2o2eFM1cCCJo4fSABSie4qWw">website</a>, where recent department publications are highlighted on the right hand side of page.
</p>
<p>API access also means that it is possible to automatically add information to the ORCID records of researchers who have granted permissions.<br>
</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about the API and how it can be accessed or used, please contact <a href="mailto:thane@ualberta.ca" target="_blank">Thane Chambers</a>.  780-492-9684
