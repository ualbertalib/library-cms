<h3>Prepare my Data Management Plan (DMP)</h3>
<h4>A data management plan (DMP) will:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>define the steps you need to manage your data</li>
	<li>strengthen your research ethics application</li>
	<li>ensure you follow funder and journal requirements</li>
	<li>clarify what you need for longer-term data management</li>
	<li>give your data a longer lifespan and strengthen your research process</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Management Plan (DMP) Consultation</h4>
<p>Consulting with Libraries' staff can be arranged anytime during the data management lifecycle: <a href="mailto:data@ualberta.ca">data@ualberta.ca</a>.

<h3>Protect Your Data</h3>
<p>The Office of the Vice Provost (Information Technology) states, "Data protection and safeguards must be implemented in a manner that is commensurate with its value and sensitivity." If you have confidential data you should consider data encryption. A computer is vulnerable to physical security and may be stolen or hacked.
