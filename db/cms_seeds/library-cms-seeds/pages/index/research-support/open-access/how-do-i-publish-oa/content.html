<h3>As a Researcher / Author</h3><ul>
	<li>Upload copies of your peer-reviewed articles to <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/research-support/era">ERA: Education and Research Archive</a>.
	<ul>
		<li>Email <a href="mailto:erahelp@ualberta.ca">erahelp@ualberta.ca</a> for technical and copyright assistance.</li>

	<li><a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">SHERPA/Romeo</a> tells you what journals publish OA, with information on copyright.</li>
	<li>Open access journals are published for most academic disciplines. You can see a list of them at the <a href="https://doaj.org/">Directory of Open Access Journals</a>.</li>
	<li>Many journals offer the option to publish open access for a fee, which is either charged to the author or the institution. <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/research-support/open-access/apc">The University of Alberta Library has license agreements with a number of publishers to provide researchers with a discount or waiver on Article Processing Charges (APC)</a>.</li>
	<li>Questions about open access publishing in relation to the library's licensed resources can be directed to librarians in the <em>Collection Strategies Unit:</em> <strong>csu@ualberta.ca</strong>.</li>
</ul><h3>As a Journal Editor</h3><ul>
	<li>We host OA e-journals using the <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/">Open Journal Systems</a> software. OJS is a journal management and publishing system that has been developed by the <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/">Public Knowledge Project</a> through its federally funded efforts to expand and improve access to research.</li>
