 Article Processing Charge Support
</h1>
   
   <p>Most Open Access journals charge article processing charges (APCs), with authors required to pay a fee to cover publishing costs. In addition, many subscription-based journals provide authors with the option to provide Open Access to their articles. This choice also requires the author to pay an APC.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, the University of Alberta Library negotiates license agreements with publishers who will provide U of A authors with free OA publishing or discounts on APCs, as part of our ongoing subscriptions. The following list includes all of the publishers who currently provide APC-free or APC-discounted publishing for U of A authors.	</p>	
 <p>  
   More questions about APCs? You can  <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/ask-us">Ask Us</a>.</p>	
   <p>
     <strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> The fee waivers and discounts listed below apply only to Open Access Article Processing Charges. Any additional publisher charges must be paid by the author. The UofA Library makes every effort to provide up-to-date information on these publisher agreements, and cannot be held responsible for any APC charges resulting from publisher changes to the status of individual journals.
   </p>
