</p><hr><h2>ERA Policies</h2><h3>
ERA Content Policy
</h3><p>
	ERA hosts and preserves material related to the teaching and research activities at the University of Alberta and associated items representing intellectual production. ERA is an open access institutional repository.
</p><p>
	All work deposited in ERA must originate from a member of the University of Alberta community unless an exception is made at the discretion of the Digital Repository Services Librarian.
</p><p>
	All undergraduate student work in ERA must be vetted by a Faculty or Department.
</p><p>
	Materials of an administrative nature, such as meeting minutes or general correspondence, should be deposited at the University of Alberta Archives, not in ERA.
</p><h3>
ERA Take-Down Policy
</h3><p>
	The removal of an item from ERA once it is deposited is generally discouraged. However, items will be temporarily taken down under the following scenarios until a determination is made to either restore or permanently remove the item:
</p><ul>
	<li>A copyright dispute emerges requiring investigation.</li>
	<li>There is disagreement among multiple authors over whether the item should be placed in ERA. It is in the best interests of depositors to seek co-author permission prior to deposit.</li>
</ul><p>
	Items will be removed immediately if:
</p><ul>
	<li>We become aware of any illegal activity facilitated by an item in ERA.</li>
	<li>An ERA item is used for internet nuisance activity by a user, such as to spam others.</li>
</ul><h3>
Metadata Quality Policy
</h3><p>
	Detailed policy and practice workflows exist to ensure that ERA metadata is of the highest possible quality. Metadata already within ERA may undergo enhancement on an ad-hoc or project basis. This allows for optimum collation, dissemination, and preservation of ERA content. Contact 
	<a href="mailto:eraadmi@ualberta.ca">eraadmi@ualberta.ca</a> for more information.
</p><hr><h2>Copyright Terms and ERA </h2><p>
	When depositing items, you will be prompted to select a Creative Commons license. All items in ERA require an associated license so that others understand how the work can be used. See 
	<a href="http://creativecommons.org/about">http://creativecommons.org/about</a> for more information about Creative Commons licenses and contact <a href="mailto:erahelp@ualberta.ca">erahelp@ualberta.ca</a> for more information about copyright terms.
</p><p>
	Note that there are three ways to determine if a journal article can be deposited in ERA and in what form:
</p><ol>
	<li>SHERPA/RoMEO: provides information about journal policies for archiving articles in institutional repositories <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo</a></li>
	<li>Journal websites: many journals state their archiving policies on their website (see sections on author information or copyright)</li>
	<li>Ask the journal: use an author addendum and/or send an email request to retain your right to deposit your work in an institutional repository (e.g., the SPARC Canadian Author Addendum <a href="http://www.carl-abrc.ca/uploads/SCC/Addendum_updated-e.pdf">http://www.carl-abrc.ca/uploads/SCC/Addendum_updated-e.pdf</a>)</li>
