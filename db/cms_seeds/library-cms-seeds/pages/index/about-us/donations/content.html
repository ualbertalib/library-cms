</p><h3>Gifts-in-Kind Policy</h3><p>As of March 05, 2020, the University of Alberta Library is no longer able to accept any donations of materials for the general library collection. This includes books, magazines and journals, or multimedia items. This change in policy is necessitated by budget reductions currently being imposed on post-secondary institutions in Alberta.
</p><p>Donations of rare books and other unique materials that support teaching and research may still be considered for acquisition by Bruce Peel Special Collections. For inquiries related to rare materials, please contact Robert Desmarais, Head of Special Collections, at <a href="mailto:robert.desmarais@ualberta.ca">robert.desmarais@ualberta.ca</a>.
</p><p>Donations of archival records for the University of Alberta Archives may still be considered. For inquiries related to archival donations, please contact the University of Alberta Archives at 780-248-1300 or <a href="mailto:archives@ualberta.ca">archives@ualberta.ca</a>.
</p><p>      Please note that this policy does not address monetary or other forms of donations to the Library and Museums or to the University of Alberta. Please visit our <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/support"><strong>Support the Library</strong></a><strong> </strong>page for cash donations.<br>
