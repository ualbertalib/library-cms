      <h3>About Us</h3>

<strong> Libraries Linked</strong>, the international relations program of the University of Alberta Libraries, creates   partnerships with libraries around the world to extend the benefit of our information and knowledge    resources and related services and technologies. This allows us to develop our own collections, while   supporting the development of libraries world-wide.
</p>
<p>
	 Since our program began in 2010 our librarians have visited libraries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Europe  and the Middle East, speaking at conferences, providing specialized training and consultation, and  developing projects and programs with our international partners. During this time we have also hosted  visitors from academic libraries in many of these countries through our Professional Library Immersion  Program.
