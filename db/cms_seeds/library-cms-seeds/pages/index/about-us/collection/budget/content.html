<h1>Collections Budget Update - May 2021</h1><p>The UAlberta Library is committed to keeping our campus community and colleagues updated on changes to the collections budget in light of the post-secondary funding changes from the provincial government, as well as the impact this will have on the resources to which we provide access. The permanent reduction to collections base budget funding for fiscal year 2021-22 is $1 million (roughly 4.56%). This follows on the $3M reduction last year.
</p><p>The Collection Strategies Unit (CSU) continues to prioritize changes that will permit the greatest retention of unique material so as to minimize impact.
</p><p>To achieve the necessary spending reductions, to date the following changes to collections have been implemented:
</p><ul>
	<li><strong>Cancellation of database subscriptions where warranted based on assessment results. </strong>Decisions are based on considered interpretation of numerous sources of evidence while keeping the diversity of our collections in mind.  Factors informing decision-making include usage levels, cost per use, consultation with university staff members, perpetual access to content, etc. A list of databases cancelled to date can be <a data-cke-saved-href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IyXwuRHHsXTXM8YgcSVn2a47_jIGFqKpz17ZoFANZP8/edit?usp=sharing" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IyXwuRHHsXTXM8YgcSVn2a47_jIGFqKpz17ZoFANZP8/edit?usp=sharing">viewed here</a>. This list is actively maintained.</li>
	<li><strong>Changing the nature of selected package subscriptions. </strong>For example, this could mean changes to the comprehensiveness of the package or the platform on which the content is provided. <strong> </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Eliminating duplication of print books whenever possible</strong>, either against e-books or multiple copies of print. The Library has been e-preferred since 2013. We will follow current <a data-cke-saved-href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nE3tUt6p24Xn-LsCxDQSw5kHVOxYgkg6pBWNQS1uTc8/edit?ts=5d654e81" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nE3tUt6p24Xn-LsCxDQSw5kHVOxYgkg6pBWNQS1uTc8/edit?ts=5d654e81">Guidelines</a> to determine cases where exceptions will be permitted. The exception to this change is books that are part of the textbook lending program - print purchases will resume when campus reopens.</li>
	<li><strong>Reducing the overall number of print books</strong> being acquired.</li>
	<li><strong>Reducing the number of print journals</strong> being acquired, retaining only those titles that are actively used.</li>
</ul><p>The next phase for FY 2021-22 will involve continuing the review of various categories of ongoing expenditures (e.g., databases, ejournal and ebook packages, print monographic series) and making cancellation decisions based on data and consultation.
</p><p>None of these measures are absolute as there are always specific circumstances to consider, but these points will guide our general direction going forward.
</p><p>You can expect to hear more about changes to the collection here in the upcoming months. As reductions continue, consultation with faculty may be undertaken to inform more difficult decisions. Your feedback is always welcome and will be taken into consideration.
</p><p>Thank you for your understanding. Questions can be sent to <a data-cke-saved-href="mailto:csu@ualberta.ca" href="mailto:csu@ualberta.ca">csu@ualberta.ca</a>
