<h2>Study and Work Space Policies for the University of Alberta Library</h2>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The Library is a place for learning. People need quiet places to learn and work as well as spaces for group learning and collaboration. The Library is also a centre for teaching, where library staff instruct individuals and groups in the use of information resources and materials. To create an environment that meets the study and work needs of our campus community, we have established zones in the library to suit varying types of study:<br>

</p>
<!---
<ul>
	<li><strong>Silent <strong>Zone</strong></strong> - Intended to serve as silent, individual study space for readers and students who need to concentrate. No talking is permitted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Quiet <strong>Zone</strong></strong> - Intended to serve as quiet space for readers and students. In these zones only low-level talking is permitted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Collaborative Zone</strong> - Usually busy with high traffic levels. These zones are intended as group study areas and / or instructional areas and include library service desk areas. Here, conversational noise is to be expected. <a href="/services/book-study-space">Book Group Study Space.</a><span id="selection-marker-1" class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></li>
