<h2>Library Closures and 2020 Budget
</h2><p>In late 2019 and early 2020, as the University administration moved to address cuts to the Campus Alberta Grant by assigning successive budget cuts to Faculties and units, the Library administration had to develop a set of scenarios to respond to various levels of potential cuts. By March, we faced a dire budget situation with no time for staging cuts across years or slowly adjusting our expenditures to arrive at a reduced level. In such a situation, we have limited options.
</p><p>Roughly half of the Libraryâ€™s budget goes toward purchasing print and digital materials for the collection in order to support teaching, learning, and research. The other half of the budget goes toward staff salaries and everything that falls under the heading of operations, which includes everything from computing equipment to furniture to basic supplies. We applied the budget cuts equally to these two halves. As with many units on campus, we have permanently laid off staff, drastically reduced our casual labour budget, eliminated internships and residencies, and reduced computing and other expenditures. Even with this, we would still have a deficit and the government has signalled further cuts to the Campus Alberta grant in the next two years; beyond this, we now have the as yet unknown economic effects of the pandemic. In such a scenario, we had no choice but to consider closing locations.
</p><p>Closing locations enables us to reabsorb the staff from closed libraries into other locations so that we can backfill positions lost to attrition. If we do not do this, service slowly degrades across the entire system: fewer opening hours, less personal assistance, longer delivery times for collection items, spaces less conducive to study. It also allows us to reduce our computing fleet, which generates hardware, software, and support savings. Facilities costs--maintenance, furnishings, renovation--also cease when a location is closed.
</p><p>This type of consolidation of locations is not uncommon and has occurred over time at many of our peer institutions in Canada and beyond. Most library systems previously had more libraries than they currently do. The impact of this was more severe when this happened in the twentieth century, when print collections dominated.
</p><p>We are well-positioned to offer library services and resources in a digital environment and we continue to build on this. In 2020, we direct approximately 75% of the funds we invest in collections toward digital content and we have a technically sophisticated staff offering a wide range of online services: online chat support, sophisticated publishing systems, multiple research repositories, and many others.
</p><p>It is with sadness that we must close two libraries but we remain dedicated to serving the students and faculty to the level of excellence that we have established over our long history.
