  Prepare Your Entry

<p>
  Students may submit projects or assignments in English or French. However, the submission forms for both students (including the reflective statement) and instructors should be completed in English. When projects or assignments in French are submitted, the committee will consult with French speakers within the Library system to evaluate how extensively library resources were used in the project, and they will provide a brief summary of this for the review of the submission by the judges and committee members.

  AI Declaration of Use
</h2>
<p>
  The use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including ChatGPT and other large language models, is becoming common in research. These tools can help with tasks such as brainstorming topics, finding information sources, or improving writing. However, AI cannot be listed as an author because it cannot take responsibility for submitted work. Examples of acceptable AI use may include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Research literature searching tools and recommenders</li>
  <li>Tools that help improve typing and grammar</li>
  <li>Tools used to brainstorm and generate ideas, and keywords, and refine topics</li>
  <li>Tools used to generate images or graphics</li>
  <li>Data analysis tools</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The application form includes a section that asks whether you used AI in your submission. If you did, you must disclose which tools you used and how you used them. You should also address any use of AI in your reflective statement.
</p>
<p>
  The research prize committee recognizes that, in some cases, you may be permitted or even required to use AI tools in your work. You will not be penalized for responsible and transparent use of AI in your research project. However, you must write the reflective statement in your own words, without using AI.
</p>

  Please note: To protect authors’ rights and the confidentiality of submissions, prize adjudicators will not use generative AI or AI-assisted technologies, including AI-detection software such as Turnitin.
