<h1>
  Understanding the Evaluation Process
</h1>
<p>
  Prizes will be awarded at the discretion of the Library Prize for Undergraduate Research committee. This committee is composed of both librarians and non-librarian members, such as faculty and researchers. 
</p>
<p>
  Eligible submissions will be reviewed by using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1elPJLEH2qAENwgydxgmIFKUKffwqGj76d5TrHxfx4Q8/edit?usp=sharing">Evaluation Criteria Rubric</a>. The process will be anonymized, where the reviewers will not be provided with any identifying information for the submissions. Each submission will be reviewed and scored by 2 committee members and the Chair will break any tied scores if needed. A score will be provided for the following elements: Research Project (0-6 points), Reflective Statement (0-6 points). The instructor support form will be used to inform the adjudication process, but it will not be scored.
