<p>
  The newly established Library Prize for Undergraduate Research is an opportunity for current University of Alberta undergraduate students from all disciplines to showcase their outstanding scholarly projects that demonstrate research skills and innovative use of a variety of services and resources provided by the University of Alberta Library. Applying for these prizes gives students a chance to think critically about their research journey, showcase their work to a broader audience, and celebrate undergraduate academic excellence at the University of Alberta.

  The Library Prize for Undergraduate Research recognizes exceptional student work that showcases:

  <li>Growth and reflection in the research and information-gathering process</li>
</ul>

    <li>First place: $1250</li>
    <li>Honorable mention: $750</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Group student award:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>First place: $1500 (shared between members of the group)</li>
