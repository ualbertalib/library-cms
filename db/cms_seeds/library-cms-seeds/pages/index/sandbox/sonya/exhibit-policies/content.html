<h1>
  U of A Library Exhibit Policy
</h1>
<h2 class="text-uppercase">
  Goals + Scope
</h2>
<p>
  The University of Alberta Library’s mission is to foster the creation of knowledge, to enable its dissemination, and to ensure its preservation. Tied to our mission is our goal to cultivate an environment within our academic library spaces that fosters curiosity, celebrates scholarship, creative work, and lifelong learning.  
</p>
<p>
  Our goal is to increase awareness, appreciation and use of the Library and its resources, spaces and services by developing and hosting interesting, creative exhibits<sup>1</sup> that educate, inform, engage, and provoke intellectual inquiry. We aim to engage diverse audiences, including students, faculty, staff, and the broader community, in meaningful exploration of knowledge, creativity, and critical inquiry. Exhibits will: 
</p>
<ul>
 <li>Highlight academic themes as well as related areas of information and knowledge relevant to the UofA community.</li> 
  <li>Showcase Library materials relevant to campus activities, local or national events significant to the academic community, and ongoing programs.</li>
  <li>Feature and celebrate student academic work, research, and creative projects, demonstrating the depth and diversity of student scholarship at UofA.</li>
 <li>Foster collaborations with various university-affiliated groups to strengthen the impact and reach of the Library's exhibit program.</li>
  <li>Celebrate the achievements of people and organizations related to the University of Alberta.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our exhibits program serves as a reflection of our commitment to supporting academic teaching, learning and research, fostering a culture of inclusion and community, and advancing the mission of the University of Alberta as a hub of learning and discovery.
</p>
<p>
  This policy applies to the following library locations: Augustana, Bibliothèque Saint-Jean, Cameron Science + Engineering, Rutherford Humanities, Social Sciences + Education, Sperber Health Sciences and Weir Law. Policies and procedures described here do not cover <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190418184943/https://bpsc.library.ualberta.ca/exhibits">the exhibitions program at Bruce Peel Special Collections</a>. 
</p>
<hr>
<i><sup>1</sup>Exhibits refers to both a larger selection of curated materials and/or creative works that require interpretation, as well as a small selection of materials that are gathered as more of a show-and-tell, that may be referred to as a display. Book displays are a subset of exhibits and fall under this policy, but are not bookable spaces.</i>

    <h4 class="card-title">Exhibit Locations + Equipment Use</h4>
    <p class="card-text">The availability of exhibit spaces and associated equipment, such as display panels, tables, and exhibit cases, vary by library location. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jkTFAHFBtLdTVodNqAN-zVcWpfh0HMgQwBk3TUbx5zs/edit?usp=sharing">Guidelines for Exhibitors</a> for lists of exhibit furniture and equipment available. All other equipment needs are the responsibility of the exhibit or event organizer. The Library does not lend exhibit and display materials or equipment beyond their use in our exhibits program, with the exception of the lending of display panels at the Augustana campus. Exhibit installations are the responsibility of the exhibitor.</p>

    <h4 class="card-title">Safety + Security</h4>
    <p class="card-text">Exhibition spaces are not monitored and the Library is not responsible for lost, stolen, or damaged materials including materials that are located within locked cabinets/display boxes. The Library does not provide insurance for exhibits. Exhibitors must arrange for insurance, or exhibit at their own risk.</p>
    <p>
      Exhibits must accommodate the unobstructed flow of users through the space, including those using wheelchairs and other assistive devices, and not present any safety hazards.  Exhibit furniture must not block any emergency equipment, including fire extinguishers and pull alarms. Building exit signs must remain visible, and not be blocked by exhibit components. Any activity taking place within University space must comply with applicable laws and University policies.

    <h4 class="card-title">Selection Criteria</h4>
    <p class="card-text">While the University of Alberta Library welcomes collaboration with our library colleagues, faculty, research institutes, campus departments and official student groups, we reserve the right to approve proposals or suggestions for exhibits, to refuse requests, to cancel exhibits and request removal, if necessary. The Library also reserves the right to make decisions about installation, duration and timing, publicity, layout and content of exhibits to ensure that they comply with the following criteria:  </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Topics for exhibits must be related to the goals listed above in this policy.</li>
      <li>Exhibits must be relevant to the library’s role in supporting the teaching and research activities of the university.</li>
      <li>Exhibits for promotional or commercial purposes are not acceptable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The University of Alberta Library strives to create inclusive spaces where diverse perspectives are respected and celebrated. However, we recognize the importance of ensuring that displays and exhibits do not inadvertently perpetuate harm or marginalize certain groups. Therefore, there may be restrictions on content that is deemed offensive, discriminatory, or harmful to individuals or communities based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disability. </p>
    <p>
      University of Alberta Library subscribes to the professional codes and standards adopted by the Canadian Federation of Library Associations, including the <a href="https://cfla-fcab.ca/en/guidelines-and-position-papers/statement-on-intellectual-freedom-and-libraries/">Statement on Intellectual Freedom and Libraries</a>.
