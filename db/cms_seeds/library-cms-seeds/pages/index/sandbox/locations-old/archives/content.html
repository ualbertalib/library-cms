              <h2>University of Alberta Archives</h2>
              <p>The University of Alberta Archives is the official repository for the permanently valuable records of the University of Alberta and its affiliated institutions. Our holdings consist of material that is of continuing administrative, legal, or historical value. In addition to administrative and academic records, the Archives also collects University publications and the private papers of faculty, staff, students, alumni, and various university-related organizations. The Archives contains the records of many notable individuals and organizations relating to Alberta and federal politics, the oil sands, theater, education, and western settlement.</p>


<p>The Archives preserves over 9,000 linear metres of records. This includes textual records, photographs, audio and video recordings, film, microforms, architectural drawings, and maps.</p>
