              <p>The Rutherford Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Library is the largest library on campus and the second largest research library in Canada. Our collections and services support study, teaching, and research in the Faculties of Arts, Education, and Native Studies, and related disciplines. The library is zoned for three levels of noise, silent, quiet and collaborative.</p>
 
 <p>Rutherford North's five floors include Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Education, and Music collections, computing &amp; study spaces, and the Interlibrary Loans Office.  In Rutherford South, you will find a study hall, our large reading room and computer labs.  The <a href="/locations/bpsc">Bruce Peel Special Collections Library</a> is located in the basement of Rutherford South. The two buildings are joined by a sky-lighted galleria.</p>
