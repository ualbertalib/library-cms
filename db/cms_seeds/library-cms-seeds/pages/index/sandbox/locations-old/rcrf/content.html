              <p>The new Research &amp; Collections Resource Facility (RCRF) replaces the Book and Record Depository (BARD) in housing the Depository Library. The Depository Library consists of  more than 3.5 million items from the University of Alberta Libraries that are less frequently accessed. The RCRF also houses the University of Alberta Archives and will be home to a new digitization centre. The facility is located on South Campus, just south of the Fort Edmonton/South Campus LRT station and Saville Community Sports Centre. </p>

 <p>The RCRF contains environmentally controlled storage spaces to maintain the highest standards for preservation of the Archives and Libraries’ collections. The facility includes a reading room and a multipurpose room for the use of students, faculty, and visiting researchers. All visitors must make an appointment to use the Reading Room or Multipurpose Room.
