  About Peel's Prairie Provinces
</h2>
 

<p class="my-4">
  Peel's Prairie Provinces is a resource dedicated to assisting scholars, students, and researchers of all types in their exploration of western Canadian history and the culture of the Canadian prairies.</p>

<p>
  This website is a jumping off point to the collection, which is now housed on <a href='https://archive.org/details/peel'><strong>Internet Archive</strong></a>. These materials are extremely varied – rich in both text and images, providing an extraordinarily diverse picture of the Prairie experience. Many of the items date back to the earliest days of exploration in the region and include a vast range of material dealing with every aspect of the settlement and development of the Canadian West.</p>

<p> 
  Although English-language titles predominate the collection, Peel also contains a substantial body of materials in French, Ukrainian, and other languages.</p>

<h3>
    History
</h3>

<p>  
  The online bibliography and digitized collections were built upon the original work of Bruce Peel and the updated records found within the third edition of the print Peel bibliography (Ernie B. Ingles and N. Merrill Distad, eds., Peel's bibliography of the Canadian Prairies to 1953, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2003). The Peel bibliographic database continues the work of this latest print bibliography including items published after 1953, the terminal date for its print counterpart, as well as materials outside of the original scope of the bibliography.</p>

<h3>
  What's the relationship between this online resource and Bruce Peel Special Collections?
</h3>

<p>
  Although online archive and the Bruce Peel Special Collections Library at the University of Alberta share the same namesake, their collections are not identical. The Peel Special Collections Library contains copies of many – but not all – of the books and pamphlets listed in the database. In order to determine the physical materials available through the Bruce Peel Special Collections Library, and of the University of Alberta Library in general, please consult the <a href='https://catalogue.neoslibraries.ca/?lib=universityofalberta'><strong>library's online catalogue</strong></a>.</p>

<h3>
  Where can I find the originals (in print or other physical format)?
</h3>

<p>
  The print originals were... borrowed / in catalogue / uncatalogued at BPSC, etc.
