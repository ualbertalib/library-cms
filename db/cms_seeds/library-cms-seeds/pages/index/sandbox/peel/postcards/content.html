  <p>
    The Prairie Postcards Collection consists of 14,000+ postcards depicting various aspects of life on the Canadian Prairies from the late 19th through the mid 20th centuries. </p>

<p>The majority of the cards are individuals. However, there are several ‘booklets’, some of which consist of a set of individual cards together in an ‘envelope’ which is a postcard in its own right, others of which consist of a set of smaller cards that are all attached to each other (and to the ‘main’ card) and fold-out. In both cases, each card has been digitized and described separately, but the connection to the rest of the set has been maintained in the record.</p>

<p>The physical collection is housed in the Bruce Peel Special Collections Library and is available to students, staff, and the general public for use within the Library.

       <h4 class="mt-3"> Statement on catalogue and resource descriptions:</h4>

<p class="mb-4 pb-4">
  
  The University of Alberta Library recognizes that our catalogue and resource descriptions contain language that reflects the biases, norms, and perspectives of the time in which they were created. In particular, for resources about persons and groups, this language is often outdated and harmful. These descriptions also incorporate controlled vocabularies, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, which include some headings (e.g., Indians of North America), that are offensive or inappropriate. We use international standards for description, but support and actively participate in efforts to update and change these practices as we strive for descriptions that are inclusive, respectful, and do not cause harm. We acknowledge the critical importance of community consultation in these efforts, and as residents on Treaty 6 territory and Métis Region 4, we commit to working together with our local communities to make these changes. </p>
