  <p>The library's teaching program consists of three elements: program/course integrated instruction; general workshops; and a suite of online instructional resources designed to help our community of users find, access, use, evaluate, and cite resources in our print and electronic collections. 
      <p>Instructors are invited to contact their <a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/about-us/staff/subject-librarians">subject librarian</a> to discuss library instruction options for their courses. Subject librarians welcome opportunities to work with instructors on projects such as:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>individualized or classroom instruction in information retrieval and research skills</li>
  <li>designing effective library assignments</li>
  <li>identifying and providing instruction on how to access, use, and evaluate relevant print and electronic collections [e.g., <a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/newspapers">newspapers</a>, <a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/case-studies">case studies</a>]</li>
 <li>identifying relevant open educational resources to support course content</li>
 <li>integrating print and digital resources into blended or online learning environments, including:
   <ul>

 <li><a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/readinglist/index.cfm">persistent links to online library resources on your reading list</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/about-us/projects/eclass-integration">library resources block in eClass</a></li>
 <li>course-specific library guides [e.g.,<a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/edu100-300/home">EDU 100/300</a>]</li>
 <li><a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/tutorials/">online library tutorials</a></li>

  <p>Learning sessions can be customized to the needs of your class and your assignment. If you an an instructor, please submit a request as early as possible to help with planning. We recommended booking at least 3 weeks in advance. Custom sessions are most effective when they are timed to when students are working on related assignments. It is recommended that your students have reviewed the foundational tutorials as these topics will not be covered in Custom Instruction. </p>
<p>Topics include, but are not limited to:  </p>
