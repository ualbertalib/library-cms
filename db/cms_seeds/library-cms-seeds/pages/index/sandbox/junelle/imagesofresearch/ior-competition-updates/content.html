</p>
<p>a. Eighteen (18) years of age or older;
</p>
<p>b. A currently enrolled U of A GPS student. A current U of A GPS student must be in good standing with U of A.

</p>
<p>You are not eligible for the Competition if you are a resident of Quebec. All decisions regarding eligibility to enter this Competition and the Entry Submissions will be determined by the U of A at its sole discretion. This Competition is void where prohibited by law.

The submissions can include photographs, images, visualizations and drawings. All Entry Submissions should be in .jpg, .png, or .tiff file formats and a minimum 200 dpi when the print size is at 11" x 17".

Entry Submissions must not be resampled in Photoshop to increase the size or dpi. Entry Submissions not meeting these specifications will be disqualified.
</p>
<p>Entrants who have entered this competition in previous years are welcome to reapply; however, a new image, title and description must be submitted. Winners from previous years are ineligible to enter this Competition, even with a new image.
</p>
<p>Eligible Entrants will grant to the University of Alberta the non-exclusive rights to reproduce, and/or distribute the Entry Submission in print and digital media in an open access environment under the “Attribution CC BY license.” This license lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon the Entry Submission even commercially, as long as the user credits the Eligible Entrant for the original creation.
