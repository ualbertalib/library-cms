<h2>What is <em>Don't Judge A Book By Its Cover?</em></h2>
  <p><em>Don’t Judge a Book by Its Cover</em> is an annual event hosted by the University of Alberta Library that aims to shed light on underrepresented groups.</p>
    <hr> 
  
<h2>How do we do this?</h2>
<p> As a twist on regular book displays, selected books from this year's theme are wrapped in brown paper and teaser keywords are written on the front. This wrapping symbolizes the marginalization of the group, and puts the focus on the content of the story.
<hr>
  <h2>How can these items be checked out?</h2>
  <p>
    Our 2024 <i>Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover</i> displays will be available at all <a href="/hours-locations">U of A Library locations</a> from Monday, November 18th to Sunday, December 1st.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li> Select your wrapped book(s) from the display based on the teaser keywords, but don't unwrap it yet!</li>
<li>Bring your chosen book(s) directly to our Service Desk with your library card; please do not use the library self-check out machines for these items.</li>
<li>Our staff will check the items out to your account.</li>
 <li>    Unwrap your book and enjoy your read!</li>
  </ul>
