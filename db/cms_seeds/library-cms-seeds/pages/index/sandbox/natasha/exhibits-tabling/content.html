    <h1>Exhibits + Tabling at the Library</h1>
    
    <p>The University of Alberta Library offers opportunities for faculty, departments, and university-affiliated groups to share their work and connect with the campus community through exhibits and tabling at select library locations. Questions about library event spaces can be directed to: <a href="mailto:library.events@ualberta.ca">library.events@ualberta.ca</a> </p>
    
    <h2>Exhibits</h2>
   
    <p>We offer exhibit spaces at Cameron Library, Rutherford Library, Augustana Library, Sperber Library, and Bibliothèque Saint-Jean.</p>
      <p><strong>Key guidelines:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exhibits must align with the Library's <a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/about/vision">mission and vision</a></li>
        <li>Exhibitors are responsible for installation, maintenance, and removal of their exhibits; library staff are not available to help
</li>
        <li>The Library reserves the right to remove any materials that do not comply with guidelines</li>
        <li>Exhibits may not include commercial advertising or fundraising activities</li>
      <li>Exhibits must occur during normal open hours and should not require closing any part of the library</li>
