APC Discounts & Waivers
[wysiwyg content]
<p>The UofA Library does not provide funding in support of Article Processing Charges (APCs) to make research papers Open Access, nor do we purchase memberships to attain APC discounts.
</p><p> Wherever possible, the Library negotiates license agreements with publishers that will provide UofA authors with discounts or waivers on APCs, as part of our ongoing subscriptions. The following list includes all of the publishers who currently provide these. In most cases, these discounts and waivers apply only if the corresponding author is affiliated with the University of Alberta.
