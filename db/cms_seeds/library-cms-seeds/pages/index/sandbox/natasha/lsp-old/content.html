<h1>What is a Library Services Platform (LSP)?</h1>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-8">
    <p>Library Services Platform (LSP) is the name for the next generation of ILS (Integrated Library Services) applications. LSPs are built using more modern technology and frameworks. LSPs follow a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">Software as a Service</a> (SaaS) model, which means that LSPs are cloud hosted and run on a subscription basis.</p>

<p>Services which <strong>will be</strong> impacted by the move from an ILS to an LSP include:</p>
<ul>
  
<li>All functions of the ILS including Workflows</li>
<li>Circulation</li>
<li>Cataloging</li>
<li>Discovery</li>
  <li>Electronic Resource Management</li>
<li>Any service which connects to our catalogue, or  SirsiDynix</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      Services which <strong>may be</strong> assessed for inclusion include: </p>
      <ul>
        
    
      <li>Interlibrary Loans (ILL)</li>
      <li>Acquisitions</li>
      <li>Website Content Management System (CMS)</li>
        </ul>
