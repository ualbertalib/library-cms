<h1>Library Service Platform (LSP) Project</h1>
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-9">
   
<p>University of Alberta has selected <strong>Alma</strong> and <strong>Primo VE</strong> from ExLibris as the new Library Services Platform (LSP) and front-end Discovery System.</p>

<p>The new LSP will serve as a cornerstone for the library to:</p>
<ul>
  

<li><strong>Support Teaching, Learning and Research:</strong> Strengthen and expand connections between learners, instructors and researchers to resources both online and onsite.</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Sustainability:</strong> Transform services, operations, and infrastructure to adapt to the evolving needs of the University of Alberta and the wider academic community.</li>
<li><strong>Advance Open Access and Scholarship:</strong> Drive key infrastructure initiatives to support faculty research and foster expanded opportunities for national and international collaboration.</li>
  </ul>

<p>The new system will also enable innovation, including AI-based discovery services and align with <em>Braiding Past, Present and Future</em> (the University’s Indigenous Strategic Plan) with new systems support for alternative and respectful vocabulary usage, facilitating  the library's ongoing work in decolonizing descriptions.</p>

<p>As implementation begins, the University of Alberta Library will focus on a user-centred approach and universal design principles to:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Support diverse learning needs and accessibility</li>
<li>Provide a more consistent and intuitive interface for discovery and access of library resources and services</li>
<li>Integrate with other campus services to provide a more seamless student experience</li>
  </ul>

<h2>What is an LSP?</h2>

<p>
  A Library Services Platform (LSP) is built using more modern technology and frameworks than the traditional Integrated Library System (ILS). LSPs follow a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, meaning they are cloud hosted and run on a subscription basis. For a more detailed explanation of LSPs please check out <a href="https://librarytechnology.org/document/25609">Smart Libraries Q&amp;A: Differences between ILS and LSP</a> by Marshall Breeding.</p>

<h2>Background </h2>


<p>The University of Alberta Library has faced significant challenges due to the outdated integrated library system (ILS) that has been in use for the past 20+ years. As a system that was primarily designed to handle print materials, the legacy system is unable to effectively and efficiently handle the integration of all workflows for both print and digital collections, and support new practices and standards to manage resources, resulting in limitations, inefficiencies and poor experiences for library staff and users.  Additionally, the current system is based on 25+-year-old technology architecture, making it increasingly expensive and unstable to maintain and support.</p>

<p>As part of our 2023-2024 strategic goals, UAL has embarked on a project to select and migrate to a new Library Service Platform (LSP) with the latest library system technologies, scalable system architecture, and infrastructure in the next 2 years. This migration will enable the Library to move to a more modern platform that will result in significant savings in staff resources to support and maintain, increase workflow efficiencies within the library, and improve user experiences for the end-users with more unified and consistent experiences. This project aligns with UAL’s priorities to enhance the usability, accessibility, and discoverability of its collections by having an enhanced technology ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Implementation Oversight Committee</h2>
<p>
  
To facilitate this transition, the Library has established an Implementation Oversight Committee to ensure proper governance, oversight, and support for the operational demands of the project. </p>
