  Important Service Update: <strong>Temporary Pause of Alumni e-Resource Access</strong></p>
  <p>Effective Date: <strong>November 28, 2025</strong></p>
  <p>The University of Alberta Library is preparing to launch a new authentication system for alumni e-resources. During this transition, <strong>we must temporarily suspend access</strong> to the current suite of e-resources.</p>

  <p>As an interim solution, we recommend exploring the following:</p>
  <ul>
    
<li><a href="https://library.ualberta.ca/">Search the Library</a> - limit your search results to Open Access in order to immediately access freely available content</li>
    <li><a href="https://guides.library.ualberta.ca/free-online-resources?">Free Online Resources Guide</a></li>
      </ul>
<p>We sincerely apologize for this disruption. We are working diligently on the new system and anticipate rolling out the new and improved access in the summer of 2026. </p>
<p>We appreciate your patience and look forward to welcoming you back to a better service experience next year.</p>
