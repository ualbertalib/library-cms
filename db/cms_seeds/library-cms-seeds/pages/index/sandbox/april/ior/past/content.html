    </h3>	
    <p>   Images of Research competition returned for a fifth year and ran from January 20 to February 7, 2020 at the University of Alberta. Over 80 unique images were submitted from graduate students across various disciplines, representing many UAlberta faculties. The competition was followed by a <a href="https://sites.library.ualberta.ca/ior-2020/">virtual exhibition</a> of the top twenty-four images throughout April 2020.</p> 
    <p>
Winning and semi-finalist images featured in the IOR exhibit were selected by a six-member adjudication panel that included both academic and non-academic staff, as well as non-participating graduate students. For the second year of the People’s Choice Award, the public voted for their favourite of the 24 semifinalists. We collected over 2763 votes with the winning image getting 772 votes.
