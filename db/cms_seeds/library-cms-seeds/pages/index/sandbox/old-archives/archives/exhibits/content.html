       Soldiers' Comfort Club 
      </h3>
             <p> The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170519222323/http://archives.library.ualberta.ca/findingaids/comforts-club/">Soldiers' Comfort Club</a> was organized by U of A students and faculty from 1915-1917 who wanted to support the war effort on the home front. The Club was coordinated by a group of U of A women with the purpose of sending such comforts as socks, cigarettes, shirts, sweets, letters and, most importantly, newsletters to homesick students and faculty in training or in overseas service.
