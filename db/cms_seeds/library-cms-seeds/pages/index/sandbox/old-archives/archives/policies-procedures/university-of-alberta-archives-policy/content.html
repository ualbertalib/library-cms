<h2>University of Alberta Archives Policy </h2><p><br>
</p><h3> Overview </h3><p>In the 1960s and 1970s the University recognized the importance of preserving archival material for
institutional accountability, research and teaching purposes. By establishing the position of University
Archivist and establishing the University Archives, the Board of Governors in 1967, 1969 and 1974 took
steps to identify, acquire, preserve and make available:
</p><ul>
	<li>University recorded information of enduring archival value, which documents its corporate
memory.
	</li>

staff or organizations or institutions affiliated to the University which enhance the corporate
memory
	</li>
	<li>Recorded information of enduring archival value created or received by individuals, organizations
and institutions the acquisition of which would support of the academic mandate of the University.
	</li>
</ul><p>In addition, the University recognized that, as part of its accountability to Albertans and its faculty, staff
and students, it was responsible for the efficient and effective management of its recorded information
resources in all mediums created or received by faculty or, staff in the course of the performance of their
duties.
</p><p>The University recognized its responsibility to protect personal information and provide appropriate
access to non-personal information. In addition, the University recognizes the need to establish a formal
process for the legal disposal of its information resources, regardless of its media.
</p><p>The Board also recognized the relationship between the preservation of University recorded information
of enduring archival value and an efficient and effective records management program, which identifies
such recorded information and ensures its transfer to, and preservation by, the Archives in appropriate
storage facilities and environments.
