</ul><h3><a name="mission">Mission</a>
</h3><p>The University of Alberta plays a fundamental role in the educational, economic, social
and cultural development of the Province of Alberta and Canada. The University of
Alberta Archives endeavors to selectively preserve the documentary heritage of this
experience in cooperation with other provincial, national and international archival
institutions.
</p><p>The University of Alberta Archives serves three purposes:
</p><ul>
	<li>The Archives constitutes the institutional memory of its sponsoring body, the
University of Alberta.
	</li>
	<li>The Archives serves the University Community as a resource centre for research
and teaching activities.
	</li>
	<li>The Archives preserves a full and varied remembrance of non-official functions,
activities, and experiences associated with the history and development of the
general University Community and all its affiliated constituents.
	</li>
</ul><h3><a name="responsibility">Functional Responsibility</a>
</h3><ul>
	<li>to preserve the university's institutional memory through the preservation of its
records and publications of enduring value. The Archives is assigned authority to
appraise, acquire, maintain, and make available documentary evidence,
regardless of media, on the structure, policies, functions, and decisions of the
University. The University Archivist operates in conjunction with the University
Records Management Office to support the University records management
program including the selection and appraisal and acquisition of the appropriate
official university records. Responsibility for the final disposition of official
university records into the UAA resides with the Board of Governors acting
through the University Archivist, or designate.
	</li>
	<li>to acquire documents serving the institution's vocational roles of research and
teaching. In order to formulate a balanced and valuable research and teaching
resource the Archives shall maintain an appropriate dialogue with faculty and
staff regarding acquisition needs.
	</li>
	<li>to preserve records providing an inclusive historical narrative of the University's
various non-official constituents. Such records supply a context to the official
records of the University, facilitate curriculum development and departmental
policy, support public relations activities, and provide a sense of individual and
collective identity to campus constituents. This historical resource is the unique
memory of otherwise undocumented campus experiences. The University
Archives is responsible to select records from appropriate campus groups to
account for the historical experiences of students, faculty, campus employees,
private organizations and individuals involved in university life. 
	</li>
	<li>to liaison with other archival agencies within the province in a common
endeavor to preserve the provincial documentary heritage and make this
aggregated provincial resource available in a secure, networked, and accessible
manner. 
	</li>
	<li>to receive and preserve all archival material transferred to the UAA from
faculties, departments and business units of the University of Alberta and its
constituent parts. 
	</li>
</ul><h3><a name="scope">Administrative Authorities and Scope
</a></h3><ul>
	<li>The June 7, 1974 Board of Governor’s policy statement (item 4) titled “The
University of Alberta Archives Policy-Documents Retention and Disposal,” assigns
the University Archivist authority to draft and enforce disposition schedules for
all official university documents. 
	</li>
	<li>The 1969 “University of Alberta Archives Policy” assigns responsibility to the
University Archivist for the following activities: advise on records management
for the University; acquire, preserve and make available unofficial and/or private
records; maintain a liaison with other archival agencies within the province in a
common endeavor to preserve its academic and cultural heritage; ensure that
the rules and regulations governing the access to and, the use of, material are
observed. 
	</li>
	<li>The Alberta Post-Secondary Learning Act mandates the University’s programs
and services to collect information in the course of their normal operations.
Archival records schedules address the acquisition of appropriate records from
University functions and activities.
	</li>
	<li>Donation agreements made with the Archives shall address the Canadian
Copyright Act ( R.S. 1985, c. C-42 ). The Archives requests copyright on donated
material unless an agreement is established with the donor concerning the
diffusion and licensing of discrete copyrighted material. 
	</li>
	<li>In accordance with the Cultural Property Export and Import Act ( R.S. 1985, c. C-
51) the Canadian Cultural Export Review Board empowers Canadian archival
agencies with responsibilities for cultural property identification and appraisal
and sets the fair market value of gifts. The University of Alberta Archives is an
authorized institution under this act. 
	</li>
	<li>The provincial Historical Resources Act Chapter H-9 carries provisions concerning
the authenticity of copies of records as evidence and proof and shall apply when
the University Archives acquires, receives, transfers, disposes of, or verifies
custody of records related to provincial bodies.
 As of 1999 the University of Alberta Archives became subject to the Alberta
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (R.S.A. 2002 F -25)
providing a framework for public access to records and for the protection of
privacy. The Act requires reasonable security arrangements to protect personal
information and empowers the Information and Privacy Commissioner to
conduct investigations in government organizations to ensure compliance with
rules for the destruction of records. 
	</li>
	<li>An Archives is defined as the whole of the documents made and received by a
juridical or physical person or organization in the conduct of affairs, regardless of
date, physical form, or characteristics and preserved because of their enduring
value. This is synonymous with the term fonds.
	</li>
	<li>As defined under the Alberta Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy
Act "record" means a record of information in any form and includes notes,
images, audiovisual recordings, x-rays, books, documents, maps, drawings,
photographs, letters, vouchers and papers and any other information that is
written, photographed, recorded or stored in any manner, but does not include
software or any mechanism that produces records. 
	</li>
	<li>The Income Tax Act R.S.C. 1985 provides procedures and requirements for
eligibility for federal tax credits to owners of private documents who decide to
donate their material to public Archives. 
	</li>
	<li>Artifacts, defined as a “products of human art or workmanship,” are not
normally acquired under this Acquisition Policy unless there are extenuating
circumstances or if they are official publications of the university. 
	</li>
	<li>The University Archives does not generally acquire books or, published materials
unless there are special or compelling reasons for them to accompany acquired
archival records or, if they are official publications of the University. 
	</li>

	<li>Acquisitions are made in conformity with prevailing legislation relating to archival
functions. 
	</li>
	<li>Archival material donated to the University of Alberta or its Archives becomes the
property of the institution.
	</li>
	<li>The University Archives's acquisition policy shall conform to the four main tenets of
the 'total archives' approach to acquisition. These include the following:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>the Archives will, at its discretion, acquire archival material through its
acquisition criteria regardless of media. 
		</li>
		<li>the Archives, at its discretion, may acquire material that documents all
relevant social, political, and economic strata of society it serves. 
		</li>
		<li>the archives will advise and, where appropriate, assist the University Records
Office in the management of University records as part of the University
records management program. 
		</li>
		<li> the Archives will work, where appropriate, support provincial, national and
international archival institutions and organizations to maintain an
integrated network of archival resources. 
		</li>
	</ul>
	<li>All private records acquisitions must conform to the framework of the acquisition
policy. 
	</li>
	<li>Working with selected records officials the University Archivist will individually
appraise and schedule the official records created by each discrete campus office.

	</ul><p>With the growth of modern administration, developments in information technology,
and growing research pressures from social history, the humanities and natural sciences 
5
and genealogy, the University of Alberta Archives is under increasing obligation to
preserve records containing both personal and official information while, their rate of
creation is exploding. Recognizing this enormous amount of information, the Archives
will apply appraisal criteria to selectively acquire only records determined to best define
the operations and experiences of the University in all its manifestations. The Archives
will appraise official records holding personal information on an individual office basis
through records scheduling based on legislated authority. In addition, the University
Archives will acquire non-official records according to the following appraisal criteria:
</p><h4><a name="evidence">1.0. Evidential and Informational Criteria</a>
</h4><h4>1.1 Provenance
</h4><p>The identity of the creator of the records under consideration for acquisition is a
principal appraisal criterion. The creator's profile must either relate to the thematic
historical strengths of the University Archives's holdings (see 5.0), the identified
areas of priority and specialization for university research and teaching or, be of
such significance that the University Archivist decides acquisition is appropriate.
At the discretion of the UAA, individual faculty papers may be acquired if the person
has made a significant contribution to his/her professional discipline or to the
university community, professional or extra-curricular. This will be determined
according to the professor's accomplishments in the following areas: membership
on editorial boards of professional or academic journals; a strong publication list
including significant academic monographs and respected journals; a high citation
rate in the work of other academics; a high number of graduate student committee
memberships; research grant awards; teaching citations; recommendations from
other academics in relevant disciplines, significant personal accomplishments and
community contributions.
</p><h4>1.2 Integrity, and completeness of the fonds
</h4><p>Completeness of a fonds is a valuable criterion when appraising records for
acquisition. Preference will be given to records that thoroughly document the
creator's administrative, operational and if relevant, private activities. All
acquisitions will be inspected for the authenticity and integrity of the records.
</p><h4>1.3 Concentration of information
</h4><p>Preference will be given to material that offers a broad or thorough coverage of a
particular subject area.
</p><h4>1.4 Usefulness for appropriate audience
</h4><p>The Archives will give preference to acquiring material that addresses the demand of
a demonstrable and suitable audience. This will include: utility for the institution’s
operations; advocacy from a campus constituency; demands from active current
research and teaching audience; suitability for addition to the provincial, national, 
6
and international networks of archival resources (i.e. Archives Network of Alberta)
and collaborative potential.
</p><h4>1.5 Uniqueness of Information
</h4><p>The Archives will give priority to records possessing unique or original information.
The archival value of the material increases with its rarity. This includes material that
is not otherwise available. Conversely, if its information is duplicated in secondary
sources the material loses value as an archival acquisition.
</p><h4>1.6 Temporal value of the contents of Records
</h4><p>The age of information in a fonds varies in value according to the subject
documented. Records dating from the 1980s gain value if they document, for
example, genetic code mapping research, or the film career of Anne Wheeler.
</p><h4>1.7 Symbolic
</h4><p>Value
Certain documents will gain in value because they evoke or embody the symbolic
value of an event or topic. For example, documents such as Treaty 8 or, the papers
of eugenics pioneer J.M. MacEachran have an added symbolic value beyond their
worth as documentation of events or people.
</p><p><br>
</p><h4><a name="criteria">2.0 Physical and External Criteria</a>
</h4><h4>2.1 Quantity of Documents
</h4><p>A large fonds with a considerable amount of published material, ephemera or
duplicate material taxes the Archive’s resources, in terms of space and processing
resources and does not contribute significantly to the resources of the repository.
Such acquisitions will be given low priority.
</p><h4>2.2 Language
</h4><p>The University Archives can acquire and process records in French and English. There
are offices and departments (i.e. Campus St. Jean) within the administrative orbit of
the University that regularly create records in French when performing its mandated
functions. Unless they are relevant to a particularly significant research project,
acquisition priority or individual, such as the record of Ukrainian Studies the Archives
may not have the resources to acquire and manage effectively records in any other
language.
</p><h4>2.3 Physical Condition of Records
</h4><p> The Archives does not have the resources to undertake significant restoration and
 conservation projects and therefore, cannot accept records which require intensive
 conservation treatment. Records acquired must be legible and in a reasonable state
 of organization to facilitate processing. The Archives will accept records in all media
 including digital documents.
</p><h4>2.4 Media
</h4><p>Although the Archives operates on the principle of acquiring archival records of all
media, certain media formats are difficult to preserve and place an irreconcilable
burden on the Archives’ resources. Such media includes:
- severely damaged records (see 2.3).
- electronic information created and/or stored on legacy software and hardware
which is unavailable or difficult to upgrade.
- sound and moving image records recorded and/or stored on legacy formats (i.e.
wax cylinder sound recordings) that require equipment currently unavailable or,
difficult to access.
Such records will be reviewed on a case by case basis with acquisition predicated on
resources.
</p><h4>2.5 Artifacts
</h4><p> The Archives shall focus its acquisition activities on records. The Archives shall not
 acquire objects with artefactual value unless they possess a unique relationship to
 the pre-existing holdings.
</p><p><br>
</p><h4><a name="obligations">3.0 Contracts and Legal Obligations</a>
</h4><h4>3.1 Copyright
</h4><p> Copyright is a fundamental concern for every acquisition. The Archives expects
 donors to hold copyright on material under consideration for acquisition. The
 Archives requests donors to cede copyright to the University, but will nevertheless,
 consider accepting material without gaining copyright if the material is particularly
 relevant to the institution's holdings or appraisal criteria.
</p><h4>3.2 Access Status
</h4><p>The University Archives is subject to the Alberta Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy Act. The Archives might not acquire records if its access is
predominantly restricted under this Act or, in the event of a private donation, if the
donor places unwieldy access restrictions on the records. Heavily restricted material
will nevertheless be considered for acquisition if it is clear that written consent is
available for reasonable research requests.
</p><h4>3.3 Legal Authority
</h4><p> The University Archives can only accept records from persons or offices holding legal
 authority to donate records to the Archives.
</p><p><br>
</p><h4><a name="resources">4.0 Institutional Resources</a>
</h4><p>Since its inception in 1968 the University Archives has acquired hundreds of
collections of non-university records. Combined with an increasing rate of accession
and severely limited staffing, this places pressures on the institution’s archival
resources and ability to manage collections.
</p><h4>4.1 Cost of Physical Acquisition
</h4><p>The Archives does not have the resources to purchase archival records and
documents for its holdings. The Archives shall assess costs in relation to benefits on
all material to be acquired. Significant costs include professional appraisal and
moving. The Archives can assume the costs of moving within the greater Edmonton
area but may ask for donor support to meet appraisal costs and moving costs from
outside Edmonton and its environs.
</p><h4>4.2 Cost of Processing
</h4><p>Costs of processing include a trained archivist to arrange, describe, index and make
records available for research and related purposes, as well as, the cost of supplies
and space to store the material.
</p><h4>4.3 Cost of Preservation
</h4><p>Costs of preservation include:
</p><ul>
	<li>a professional conservator to evaluate and work on the material conservation
supplies.
	</li>
	<li>storage in a controlled environment.</li>
	<li>transferring the material to a digital, microfilm, microfiche or, other medium to
reduce access to the original. 
	</li>
</ul><p>The Archives does not have ready access to a conservation laboratory but may
infrequently access such facilities as Bruce Peel Special Collections or the Provincial
Archives of Alberta.
</p><h4>4.4 Cost of Access and Reference</h4><p>Costs incurred in referencing and making accessible newly acquired records include
professional time for a trained archivist; production costs for binding and
reproducing finding aids; costs of encoding digital finding aids and posting these
finding aids on the web site.
</p><p><br>
</p><h3><a name="focus">Focus of Private Records Acquisition Priorities</a>
</h3><p>Private records acquisition priorities are an amalgamation of the traditional thematic strengths of the archival institution's holdings combined with a list of prioritized acquisition fields, addressing:
</p><ul>
	<li>the territorial, physical and integrity of records. </li>
	<li>teaching and research resource concerns. </li>
	<li>the broader national concerns for preserving the documentary heritage of a
large Canadian university.
	</li>
	<li>the provincial interests in the documentary heritage of northern and greater
Albertan society.
	</li>
</ul><p>The University Archives holds traditional strengths in the following topics and will
endeavor to build on these thematic strengths:
</p><h4> Literary and Performing Arts </h4><p>To date the University Archives has acquired over 115 metres of material from various community theatre groups and individuals in Northern Alberta. Included in the 25 theatre specific fonds are over 4,000 photographs and approximately 20 hours of sound and moving image material documenting the theatrical community of the University of Alberta and the regional theatre environment.
</p><p>Donors of records concerning drama include Workshop West, Theatre Network, Catalyst Theatre, Chinook/Fringe Theatre, Nexus Theatre, Northern Light Theatre, Phoenix/Edmonton Actors Workshop, Studio Theatre, Stage Polaris, and Theatre Alberta. The Archives also holds a number of significant holdings in other genres of literary and performing arts including the Violet Archer, O.C. fonds and the records of Wilfred Watson (Canadian author).
</p><h4> Native Studies</h4><p>The University Archives has written a guide describing the University’s archival holdings concerning Native peoples. The Archives selectively solicits records relating to Native peoples regardless of media.
</p><h4>Northern Alberta and Arctic Environmental Studies (including, inter alia,
settlement, zoology, geography and biology)
</h4><p>The University Archives holds a considerable amount of records concerning the development and study of the Northern Canadian environment. Of particular note are the research records of:
</p><ul>
	<li>J. Dewey Soper (arctic and prairie naturalist).</li>
	<li>William Rowan (professor of geography). </li>
	<li>Dr. W.C. Wonders (Boreal Institute). </li>
	<li>Dr. W.A. Fuller (zoology professor). </li>
	<li>Dr. Milton Freeman (professor of zoology). </li>
</ul><h4>Earth Sciences, Engineering and Northern Resource Development</h4><p>Directly related to the environmental records of the North, the University Archives has considerable holdings in Resource Engineering and Earth Sciences. The Archives holds the papers of the Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Alberta and the Research Council of Alberta covering the years 1917 to 1939. The Archives also possess the research records of:
</p><ul>
	<li>Gordon Hodgson (oil sands pioneer). </li>
	<li>Department of Geology </li>
	<li>Sidney Martin Blair (oil sands pioneer). </li>
	<li>Karl Clark (professor of mining). </li>
	<li>John A. Allan (professor of geology)</li>
</ul><h4>Medicine and Medical Science
</h4><p>The University Archives has 34 discrete medical holdings comprising official and nonofficial
records and documents. Amongst the more significant documents include:
</p><ul>
	<li>the Alberta Medical Association</li>
	<li>The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta</li>
	<li>The University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine </li>
	<li>Dr. Heber C. Jamieson</li>
	<li>John S. McEachern Cancer Research Laboratory </li>
	<li>University of Alberta Hospital</li>
</ul><h4>Campus Organizations</h4><p>The records of non-official campus organizations represent a valuable compliment to the official records of the University. Independently they also represent the historical perspective of vital university constituencies. Archival holdings of campus organization records include:
</p><ul>
	<li>The Students Union (correspondence, reports, minutes, directives, as well as
bound copies of the Gateway, copies of the Evergreen and Gold yearbook)
	</li>
	<li>Association of Academic Staff</li>
	<li>Non Academic Staff Association</li>
	<li>Richard Eaton Singers</li>
	<li>Mixed Chorus</li>
</ul><h4>Political Records of Alberta</h4><p>The Archives holds a rich documentation of political figures from across the ideological spectrum on a local, provincial and federal political stage. Amongst the most significant holdings are records concerning:
</p><ul>
	<li>Peter J. Meekison (contributing authors of the Canadian Constitution). </li>
	<li>Alexander Rutherford Cameron (first Premier of Alberta). </li>
	<li>Ernest C. Manning (Premier of Alberta from 1943-1968).</li>
	<li>Doug Tomlinson--political activist. </li>
	<li>Bill Tuomi (political activist)
The UAA selectively acquires records relating to these and associated records, as part of
its collections mandate, regardless of media.
