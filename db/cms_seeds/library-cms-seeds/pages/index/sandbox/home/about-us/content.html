         A Message from our Chief Librarian
      </h2>
      <p>The University of Alberta Library is here to help the campus community succeed in its academic endeavours. Our staff and facilities are welcoming and we are ready to assist you with your research and studies.

      <p>Our many locations and collections are widely known and remain our core, yet we are also evolving to address new opportunities. These include open educational resources, new paradigms for scholarly communication, and the shift toward open science and open data.</p>

<p>In all of our work, we seek engagement and dialogue and look forward to working together to create an inclusive university for all. <a href="/ask-us">Please be in touch</a>!</p>
