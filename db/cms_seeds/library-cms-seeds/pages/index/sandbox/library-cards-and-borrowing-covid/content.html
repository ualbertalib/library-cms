   <p class="ml-4"><strong>Fines:</strong> We ask that you return items that have been recalled/are needed by other library users to the extent that it is possible. For help, please <a href="/ask-us">Ask Us</a>, or <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/circulation/fines/appeal/">fill out the Account Inquiry / Fines Appeal form</a> to explain your situation. We understand that returns and meeting due dates are difficult during the pandemic, and we are limiting the application of fines.</p>
   <p class="ml-4"><strong>Lost Charge:</strong> $150.00/item. At 31 days overdue, the item will be assumed lost and a lost fee of $150.00 will be applied. Please contact us via the <a href="https://web.library.ualberta.ca/circulation/fines/appeal/">Account Inquiry / Fines Appeal form</a> if you have questions about charges on your library account.</p>
