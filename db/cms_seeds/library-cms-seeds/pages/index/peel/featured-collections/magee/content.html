  <p>
      The Magee Photograph Collection consists mainly of photographic negatives, stereoscope cards, and various size prints produced by photographers Thomas B. Magee (1862-1930) and Henry L. Magee (1896-1966) of Browning, Montana. The collection was acquired by the University of Alberta in 2007 from Donald L. Magee, the son of aforementioned Henry L. Magee. A selection of 1000+ negatives and stereoscope cards have been digitized and described through a partnership with the <a href="https://uleth.ca/">University of Lethbridge</a>. The original materials are now permanently kept at the <a href="https://bpsc.library.ualberta.ca/">Bruce Peel Special Collections Library</a> at the University of Alberta.

    A detailed explanation of the digitization and description process, as well as brief biographies of the Magee family, can be found on the University of Lethbridge Library's <a  href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101008230135/http://www.uleth.ca/lib/digitized_Collections/display.asp?PageID=218">(archived) Magee Collection project</a> site.
