  <p>
    The Prairie Postcards Collection consists of 20,000+ postcards depicting various aspects of life on the Canadian Prairies from the late 19th through the mid-20th centuries. </p>

<p>The majority of the images are of individual cards. However, there are several postcard booklets, which contain a set of postcards bound together, joined in an accordion fold-out manner, or presented in an envelope (the envelope often also had an image printed on the exterior). In most cases, each card has been digitized and described separately, but the connection to the rest of the set has been maintained in the record.</p>

<p>The physical collection is housed in the <a href="https://bpsc.library.ualberta.ca/">Bruce Peel Special Collections</a> and is available for viewings by students, staff, and the general public on-site by appointment.
