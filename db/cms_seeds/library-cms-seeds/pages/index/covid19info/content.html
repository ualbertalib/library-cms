<h3>Masks Strongly Recommended</h3>
<p>We strongly recommend that you continue to wear masks in our library locations - these are high-traffic and high-capacity spaces where you may be in close proximity to others. We also ask that students, faculty, staff and visitors to the U of A Library respect the choices of others in our community regarding masking as we transition into this next phase together.</p>
     <p>Please note that <strong>masks remain mandatory</strong> at the <a href="/locations/scott">John Walter Scott Health Sciences Library</a> as this library is located in an <a href="https://www.alberta.ca/masks.aspx">Alberta Health Services operated building.</a></p>
 
      
      
      
<hr/>
<h3>Food / Drink Policy</h3>

         Course Materials </h3>   <p>Course Materials (formerly Reserves) are accessible in print with short loan periods either in a Course Materials Room or at a Service Desk in our libraries. We highly recommend creating a <a href="/reading-lists">Reading List</a>  to alert our staff to the items that you need available for your students. It may take some time to purchase and receive items, so please create your list well in advance of the start of classes each term.</p> <p>Library staff can help you identify library materials, or alternative sources of course material, that are both online and no-cost or low-cost to students. If assigning a required textbook for your students, textbook adoption requests should be submitted to the UAlberta Bookstore.</p> -->

 <li>You have 7 days to return recalled items, from the day you receive the email notification.  This recall due date cannot be altered by library staff.</li>
 <li>An overdue recall on your account will block you from borrowing or placing holds until it is returned.</li>
 <li>If you return a recall on the last day of the recall due date, your account may be blocked temporarily (up to 3 days later), while the book remains in quarantine for processing.  This block will clear once we can check the book into the library again.</li>
