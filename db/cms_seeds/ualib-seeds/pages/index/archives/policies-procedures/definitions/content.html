<h2>Definitions
</h2>
<p>These term(s) and definition(s) apply to this policy with no implied or intended institution-wide use.
</p>
<h3>Archival Appraisal</h3>
<p>The process of determining the value and thus the disposition of records based upon their current administrative, legal, and fiscal use; their evidential and informational or research value; their arrangement; their medium and format; their condition; and their relationship to other records.
</p>
<h3 >Archival Value</h3>

<p>The value and characteristics found in recorded information making it worthy of indefinite or permanent preservation by the University Archives. These qualities include their administrative, fiscal, legal, evidential, and/or informational value.
</p>
<h3>Archival Materials</h3>

<p>Archival materials are recorded information of enduring value regardless of physical format or medium, created, received or accumulated and used by individuals, families, or corporate bodies in the course of their activities or functions.
</p>
<h3>
Category “A” Designation
</h3>
<p>Awarded by the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Category “A” designation permits the institution to apply to the Canadian Cultural Property Export Review Board to have an object certified as cultural property for its collection.
</p>
<h3>Deaccession
</h3>
<p>An object that has been permanently removed from the collection; or the process of formally removing an object from the permanent collection. The deaccessioning process involves two stages. The first stage, “deaccessioning,” is the formal review and decision-making process that leads to the removal of objects from the collection, and the formal adjustment of registration records. The second stage, “disposition,” is the actual discard or transfer of ownership and possession of deaccessioned objects. A deaccession may involve a single object or a collection or lot of objects. The entire process must be formally approved by the University of Alberta, and fully documented in the collection records.
</p>

<h3>Donation
</h3>
<p>A voluntary transfer of archival property made with no direct expectation of
goods or services in return. Donors will receive a receipt for income tax
purposes for their donation. A donation must be offered by the donor, and
approved by the University Archives on behalf of the University of Alberta.
Ownership of the donated material must be irrevocably transferred to the
University.
</p>
<h3>
Fair Market Monetary Value
</h3>
<p>The price that archival materials would fetch in an open market between a
willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction, where each
party has full knowledge of the facts. It is assumed that the buyer and
seller are prudent, informed, and acting independently of each other. The
University of Alberta, as the issuer of receipts for income tax purposes, is
responsible for ensuring that the amounts shown are reasonable. The
receipt must represent the fair market monetary value of the donation at
the time when ownership is transferred to the University. Donors are
encouraged to obtain independent legal or financial advice on fair market
value.
</p>

<h3>Monetary Appraisal</h3>
<p>An estimate of fair market monetary value of donation. An appraisal is generally prepared by a qualified appraiser(s) or, in some cases, by an expert knowledgeable about the particular object in question.
