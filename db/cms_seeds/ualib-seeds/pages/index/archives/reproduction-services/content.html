	The University of Alberta Archives offers digital reproduction services of items in our holdings for all types of media, including textual, photographic, documentary art, cartographic, electronic, and audio-visual records.
</p><p>
	The Archives reserves the right to deny the reproduction of any of its holdings due to preservation concerns for a particular item. Legislation concerning personal information, copyright, and individual donor restrictions may also restrict reproduction of certain items. Each original format holds unique preservation and reproduction requirements; because information technology continually evolves, formats, policies, and procedures are numerous.
</p><p>
	Reproduction costs (subject to change) are based on four factors:
</p><ol>
	<li>Cost of acquiring, processing, preserving archival material</li>
	<li>Cost of staff time to process order</li>
	<li>Desire to limit wholesale reproduction</li>
	<li>Nature of reproduction required</li>

</p><h3><a name="citations">Citation</a></h3><p>	Whether private records or university documents, all archival records carry a set of potentially complex unique characteristics that make their citation more difficult than published library material. To capture the precise provenance details for an archival citation may require additional research. In general an archival citation progresses from the specific to the general. A full item-level citation requires a title and date of the item, the name of the series (if appropriate) followed by the name of the fonds and its identifying number ending with the name of the institution.
</p><p>For example:
</p><p>Dr. H.M. Tory to C.S. Burgess [ca. 1913], Correspondence, Acc#71-213-1-6, C.S. Burgess Fonds, University of Alberta Archives
</p><p>The Chicago Manual of Style (14th Edition) provides a thorough overview of documentation in Chapter 15. Section 15.277 concerns "manuscripts" and section 15.402 concerns "unpublished material."
</p><p>For details of any specific citation researchers should consult an archivist.
