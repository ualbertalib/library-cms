<h2>Following renovations, Bruce Peel Special Collections will re-open on June 21<span class="aBn" data-term="goog_711988363" tabindex="0"><span class="aQJ" rel="position: relative; top: 2px; z-index: -1;">, 2016</span></span>.<br></h2><p>
	This renovation is being undertaken to better support the University 

of Alberta's research and teaching programs by increasing the library's 

future storage capacity for special collections.
</p><p>
	As a result of the renovation, the following service changes will be in

place for the duration of the closure:
</p><ul class="clean-list2">
	<li class="first">There will be no access to materials from Special Collections for the

duration of the renovation. Special Collections staff will continue to

offer reproduction services with as little interruption as possible.</li>
	<li>Access to non-circulating materials from the Book and Record Depository (i.e., theses and books designated “no loan" in the library catalogue) or non-circulating interlibrary loan material on loan from other institutions <strong>will continue to be available</strong>. Please contact Peel Library staff at <a href="mailto:bpsc@ualberta.ca">bpsc@ualberta.ca</a> or by calling 780–492–7311 to book an appointment. A supervised reading room in an alternate location will be available within restricted afternoon hours. Advance booking is required.</li>
	<li>Bookings for class visits to the Peel Library will not be available for the fall term in 2015, but Peel teaching staff will continue to be available for classroom visits (without rare materials). Inquiries should be directed to Peel Library staff at <a href="mailto:bpsc@ualberta.ca">bpsc@ualberta.ca</a>.</li>

</ul><p>Special Collections will continue to consider donations

of rare books; please see the <a href="https://www.library.ualberta.ca/about-us/donations/">gifts and donations</a> web page 

for further information.</p>
